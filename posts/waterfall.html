<p>I have been thinking what my favorite RuneScape quest is. The answer
might be surprising, because it’s a small, (more or less) one-off quest
known for its rewards more than the quest’s events. I’m going to
introduce the quest and tell why I love it and how I plan to bring it to
the table.</p>
<h1 id="waterfall-quest">Waterfall Quest</h1>
<p>A boy is stranded on an island in a river just ahead of a waterfall.
His worried mother asks you to bring him home safely. But the boy is
convinced there is treasure nearby. Unwilling to leave without treasure,
you are now drafted into a treasure hunt to bring this young boy
home.</p>
<p>A small visitor center near the waterfall has an old book in it. It
tells the story of Queen Glarial and King Baxtorian, elven royalty
buried with treasure below the falls. The way into the treasure room is
locked without a small pebble belonging to Glarial, stolen by a gnome
family a century ago. You must recover the pebble.</p>
<p>The gnome family’s home has been overrun by hobgoblins. The last
gnome remains alive, having locked himself into a small room to survive.
He passes you the pebble.</p>
<p>The pebble opens Glarial’s tomb, located not under the falls, but
nearby, under a small shrine. It will not open at first. After leaving
behind all armor, weapons, and magical items will the pebble open the
tomb. Inside lurk tremendous giants made of wood and moss, standing
guard over a sarcophagus. Inside the sarcophagus is an amulet once
belonging to Glarial. You take it, leaving as quick as possible. You
also take Glarial’s ashes in an urn.</p>
<p>You return to the falls, armed with weapons, armor, and knowledge.
You enter a door in the wall of the falls, and with Glarial’s amulet you
enter unperturbed. Dungeon rooms lay out before you, with monsters many
times your power. Giants of fire and lava roam here. Spiders made of
shadow. You find a key and make your way to the backmost room.</p>
<p>Here is a shrine to King Baxtorian. You fill the chalices scattered
across the room with magical runestones, as the book you retrieved
indicated. You also return Glarial’s ashes to the tomb here, reuniting
with the dead king<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. There is a deep grinding, and a
treasure is revealed. Diamonds, gold bars, and curious metal seeds that
sprout into flowers.</p>
<p>The boy claims you stole his treasure, and will not return home.</p>
<h1 id="place-in-the-game">Place in the Game</h1>
<p>Waterfall quest is a low-level quest, mostly used for its rewards
(the skill experience points I didn’t mention). It boosts you up many
levels, and can be completed early on with some cleverness.</p>
<p>Lorewise, it gives flavour to the region of the world it takes place
in, near historically gnomish and elven lands. In RuneScape, these are
not mysterious hidden folk, but organized factions with economies,
governments, and histories. However, elves have long beengone from the
known world for unknown reasons.</p>
<p>Most players might find Waterfall quest kind of charming on a first
play, and just complete it afterwards for its rewards. It is required
for further quests in the area, but its events and history does not
develop beyond those described.</p>
<p>I think many don’t give this quest much of a second thought.</p>
<h1 id="my-analysis">My Analysis</h1>
<p>I think this quest shows great worldbuilding and lore delivery
(except for reading an old book), has a great sense of adventure, and is
a great self-contained location-based adventure. I think these features
make it perfect for an OSR-style game.</p>
<p>The worldbuilding of this quest is great because it gives an
‘impression of depth.’ I came across this term in a Wikipedia article
that uses it: <a
href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Impression_of_depth_in_The_Lord_of_the_Rings">Impression
of Depth in Lord of the Rings</a>. In short, the Wikipedia article says
Tolkein creates an impression of vast history through various literary
mechanisms, which are detailed. I’ll do a bit of the same for Waterfall
quest.</p>
<p>Waterfall quest uses in-game texts, multiple historical references by
NPCs, and hidden locations for an impression of depth. The book in the
visitor center and the text on Glarial’s shrine above her tomb both give
details about the past, and give interesting details by showing
different sides of the historical account. The historical references by
NPCs also shade the past, from the boy’s scant ‘treasure hunt’ to the
gnome survivor’s family history of Glarial’s pebble. The hidden
locations, both Glarial’s and Baxtorian’s tombs, provide a sense of
wonder at the richness of the history: it’s right beside us, all the
time.</p>
<p>The Adventure in this quest is also fantastic. There are several
types of adventure presented: treasure hunting (throughout),
infiltration (as when navigating the hobgoblin-infested gnome home), and
something like martyrdom, when you must remove your armor and weapons to
descend into Glarial’s tomb. Each is a chance of death (especially at
low level), and keeps the heart racing.</p>
<p>Many RuneScape players love the epic scale of the recent questlines.
I think this old quest has something very appealing about its
self-containment. By the end of the quest, we never learn more about
Baxtorian and Glarial, nor the gnome family<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>,
nor who the boy grows up to be. They simply exist as a memory, inviting
you to wonder what it all meant. Did you do the right thing in taking
the treasure? Shorting that boy? What historical role did these people
play? Did they go to war? The questions can keep coming. None of them
are answered. And that sense of wonder stays alive.</p>
<h1 id="bringing-to-the-table">Bringing to the Table</h1>
<p>I think I can synthesize several strategies for bringing this kind of
experience to the table:</p>
<ul>
<li>multiple sources of history, sometimes conflicting or different</li>
<li>Hidden locations, peoples, and items</li>
<li>tangible danger to players (easy in OSR)</li>
<li>Action-based advancement (there is little NPC dialogue in this
quest)</li>
</ul>
<p>History delivery is often tricky in TTRPGS. You don’t want to have a
GM monologue on irrelevant details to sate their desire to show off
their worldbuilding. But you still need to deliver that information. I
think a good tip is to keep the information itself fairly short, punchy,
and maybe include a curious loose end that ties to the present
situation. You can also have NPCs deliver history, but have have
in-world prompts for the information given. If you can keep the players
leading an interview-style dialogue, you have engaged the players well
beyond the monologue.</p>
<p>I think hidden world elements are easy to implement: just always keep
in mind the question the players will ask: why wasn’t this found before?
There are several ways to answer this, and I’ll throw out some stock
answers: it was locked, guarded, inaccessible due to terrain, visually
hidden, magically hidden, or maybe it’s known to locals but no one has
the means (or desire) to plumb its depths.</p>
<p>Tangible danger is also easy. There is plenty of writing and support
for this in OSR games. Just don’t be shy to challenge your players!</p>
<p>Action-based advancement: I like this. Again, plenty out there to
read this: see <a
href="https://www.bastionland.com/2016/05/foreground-growth-and-becoming-odd.html">diagetic
advancement</a> as well. I think this also helps to keep the players
“small” in the world: they only briefly touch the powerful forces that
set the course of the currents of the world.</p>
<p>I’m currently running <em>The Black Wyrm of Brandonsford</em> for my
group. I think I’ll incorporate some of the above for them. And most of
all, try to keep the wonder alive.</p>
