<h1 class="title">The Boy and the Heron: A Jungian Analysis</h1>
<p class="author">Sam W</p>

<p>The long-awaited Studio Ghibli movie <em>The Boy and the Heron</em>
was released at the end of last year, and I got a chance to see it in
theaters (terrible seats though). I was struck by its Jungian themes.
This post is to explain the process of Jungian dream analysis, as I have
learned it, and analyze the movie through this lens. I think this will
make a confusing movie make sense.</p>
<h1 id="how-did-i-meet-jung">How did I meet Jung?</h1>
<p>I met Jung through my parents, long-time subscribers of his theories
and ideas. I mostly came by it through the Meyers-Briggs personality
types, which I have come to revile the conventional theory of for Jung’s
ideas of cognitive functions as primary components of personality. In
any case, dream interpretation is a large component of Jungian
psychological analysis, and it’s something I discuss with my parents
quite often.</p>
<p>I have learned more about Jung outside of these discussions and
initial impressions. I own (but haven’t finished) <em>The Portable
Jung</em>, a collection of essays written by Jung and edited and
compiled by Joseph Campbell (author of <em>The Hero with a Thousand
Faces</em> on comparative mythology). I also have read a significant
portion of <em>The Symbolic Quest</em> by Edward C. Whitmont which is an
introduction to Jungian analysis for those new to it. It covers many
different aspects. I recommend this book over <em>Portable Jung</em> for
a first-time reader.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-jung-about">What is Jung About?</h1>
<p>Jung has a couple of basic ideas about the way the mind works. Being
a former student of Freud, some readers of that theory may find these
ideas familiar, but with an altogether different flavor.</p>
<p>The first big idea is that the mind is mostly unconscious
(subconscious in Freudian terms - yes, ‘subconscious’ is a Freudian
term), meaning that most of the contents of our mind are not seen by
ourselves directly. We go through our lives with a very limited vision
of ourselves, like a horse with blinders. We can see this in many ways:
confusion of why we feel a certain way when an unexpectedly
uncomfortable situation arises; the seemingly deep draw towards certain
fascinations; the complicated angst of certain types of relationships,
such as an authority figure (this is a ‘complex,’ yes, that is a Jungian
term). All of these seemingly inexplicable feelings arise from parts of
the mind not directly observed, and thus remain unknown.</p>
<p>Dreams are then seen as communications of the unconscious contents to
consciousness. They are the mind stating the current situation, though
in a convoluted and often unintelligible fashion. Thus they seem
confusing because they do not report these contents in a straightforward
message. It’s more like a fortune cookie than a scientific report. Why?
I believe it is because this makes those contents more palatable and
impactful (I actually don’t know what Jung thinks on this). By showing
convoluted and sometimes nonsensical messages, the dreamer is then
tasked with puzzling out what it meant, and the process of drawing your
own conclusions makes the result more salient. It’s like when you are
mad at somebody but are unwilling to admit it (or even personally
recognize it). If someone comes up and simply asks you, “Why are you mad
at them?” you might respond defensively and be unable to process your
frustration. But if someone points out to you all the ways you have been
acting out, you may ponder and come to the same conclusion. By puzzling
it out yourself, you are in a much better place to accept and work
through those feelings.</p>
<p>How does one analyze a dream? All the contents of the dream must be
interpreted as 1. representative of some current situation (dreams don’t
predict the future), and 2. having a distinct and personl archetypal
relationship to the dreamer. A dream always communicates in terms of
common but personal symbols to the dreamer, showing how the dreamer
feels at that moment. The elements of the dream always have to be seen
through their relationship to the dreamer in the dream. Let’s work an
example dream that I’m going to make up.</p>
<p>Let’s say I dream that I am running through the forest, chased by a
giant wolf, just out of sight. After some time I arrive at a cabin. I
enter the cabin for refuge, and see an old man by a fire. The man then
tells me to leave and fight the wolf. I wake up.</p>
<p>Ok, so a wolf is a big dangerous animal, and its chasing us,
presumably to consume me. This is indicative that in our real life,
there might be a person or engagement that is coming to ‘consume me’ in
some way: to become the only thing we know. We should examine my real
life for possible candidates that this could symbolize. Next, we find a
cabin, a refuge. Similarly, we must recognize we have a refuge from this
consuming force. We aren’t alone in the cabin, but instead some old man,
typically a figure you would venerate or think of as learned and wise,
tells us to confront this force. This means something, maybe even
internal, is urging us to directly confront the consuming force. I think
the overall message here, in modern terms, is that I have failed to set
boundaries in some relationship, and something associated to that
relationship looks to eclipse other aspects of my life. I must directly
confront this problem and set boundaries.</p>
<p>There are many other ideas in Jungian analysis, in particular of the
‘typical’ symbols arising from human nature, or as it’s called, the
collective unconscious. I won’t get into that too deeply here, but you
should keep in mind people often share or have very closely related
meaning for similar symbols: the wolf is often a voracious destructive
force, the wise old man shares wisdom, and so on.</p>
<h1 id="the-boy-and-the-heron">The Boy and the Heron</h1>
<p>How then, do we analyze a movie through a Jungian dream
interpretation lens? I think this works for the movie I saw, but does
not apply generally.</p>
<h2 id="spoilers-ahead">SPOILERS AHEAD</h2>
<p>The Boy and the Heron tells of a young boy in Tokyo during the
Pacific war who lost his mother in the a hospital fire. He then embarks
on a fantastical journey in an abandoned tower near his family’s
historic home, and emerges with a new appreciation for family. If you
want more details, read the Wikipedia plot summary.</p>
<p>On a first viewing, this definitely struck me as having a distinctly
Jungian interpretation (I don’t know if this was intended). The
structure of the story and several of its elements struck me as
archetypical, dream-like, and symbolic. To see the movie through this
lens then, I did the following: the fantastical elements of the movie
should be seen as a symbolic dream to the movie’s main character, and I
should understand this “dream’s” impact on the main character as I would
for any other dream. With that in mind, let’s dig into it!</p>
<p>The main character has a distinct maternal complex (i.e. some mass of
confusing feelings surrounding maternal figures in his life). He misses
his dead mother, and after moving to the country with his aunt, gives
her the cold shoulder. He reminisces on his mother, and engages in some
self-harm. Something is bothering him, and it’s not hard to figure out
what.</p>
<p>The fantastical journey, of which there are too many elements to
remember and analyze fully, has an overall structure: penetrate to the
base of this fantasy world, where he meets an incarnation of his
great-(great-?)uncle, who has been managing this fantastical world, and
asks the main character to take over his job. Along the way, the MC
meets a young version of his mother, and they travel together, rescuing
MC’s pregnant aunt. The movie ends with an interruption of the
great-uncle’s offer, and all must flee the collapsing world. The MC
leaves with a tighter relationship to his aunt, and seemingly having
processed his mother’s death at last.</p>
<p>Several common symbols jump out at me: the fanstical world features
heavily an ocean theme, often understood as the mass of common symbols
of humanity (the collective unconscious). The great-uncle is also a wise
old man archetype, one of the most common. So this is where I got the
idea to see it as a dream.</p>
<p>I think the MC, by reconnecting with his family’s history, first in
the guise of his young mother, and then through his great-uncle, learns
the family history he is a part of. Though it may not be some grand
history, it’s a history to carry forth. This is most telling when the
great-uncle asks him to take on the role of caretaker of the fantasy
world: the uncle wants the MC to carry forward the family history and
not dwell so intently on what was lost. Indeed, a new purpose and
mission for life can reinvigorate life, even in the face of loss.
Moreover, by carrying on the legacy of his mother and the family
history, the MC can do right by her, allowing aspects of the family to
continue forward.</p>
<p>I think the movie is a symbolic expression of the MC’s internal
journey and processing of his mother’s death, to answer the question
“what am I to do without her?” The answer comes from family history,
“express her as I live, creating new experiences for me to commune
internally with her.”</p>
<h1 id="ok-but-like-is-this-correct-is-it-valid">Ok But Like Is this
Correct? Is it Valid?</h1>
<p>It’s a good question. I think it’s an interpretation. I would ask in
return, what would make any interpretation of this movie ‘valid?’ I
would say that if we draw meaning from the movie, it is fine. Media is a
conversation that we can add to and take from it what we will. You can
have other interpretations of this movie, and it doesn’t necessarily
contradict what I said here (unless you specifically did that, of
course). It’s just an explanation of what I saw in the movie and how it
met my life at this moment. It’s as valid is it in practice: the MC
learned how to reconcile his family history with the loss he
experienced. What greater validation of this interpretation can there be
than this, the central focus of the movie?</p>
