**Expedition to the North: Rules for Snowy Adventuring**


(insert ../header.md.html here)

# Introduction

This is a ruleset based on the rules of the original fantasy RPG, with modifications and additions for play in arctic or antarctic environments. 
These rules should tell you how to play the game, though rulings by the Referee will be necessary for all the important details not included here.

I'm going to assume you are familiar with the original game.
The main changes here are to accomodate survival rules and heat retention rules.

# Character Creation

To start, roll 3d6 6 times, and keep track of the order of the results.
Then assign those results in order to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma ability scores.
The implications of those scores are explained in Section [Ability Scores].

Now roll 1d6.
This is how many hitpoints you have.
It may be modified based on your Constitution score.

Choose a character class; this determines your skills in and out of combat by fitting you with a broad fantasy archetype.
You may interpret the archetype as you like and as fits with the campaign being played.
A list of classes is in Section [Character Classes].

Roll 3d6, then multiply the result by 10. 
This is how much gold you have to begin with.
You can purchase equipment listed in Section [Equipment].


# Ability Scores

Your scores in an ability have various boons and detriments they influence.
See each below for a detailed description.

Additionally, each class has a prime requisite ability score. 
Meeting or exceeding that score grants experience bonus (in a percentage modifier).
On a 15+ for a prime requisite, you gain 5% bonus experience.
You also gain an additional 5% experience for each of a Wisdom of 15+ or Charisma of 15+.

In situations that cannot be decided through common sense, a check of a relevant ability can be made to resolve an action.
To do so, roll a d20. 
On a roll under the score of the relevant ability, the player gets their way; otherwise, the GM imposes consequences.

## Strength

For Fighter class only, strength gives an extra bonus on the to-hit roll and damage. 
See the chart below for the modifier.

| Score | To-Hit Bonus | Damage Modifier |
|:-----:|--------------|:---------------:|
| 3-4   | -2           | -1              |
| 5-6   | -1           | 0               |
| 7-15  | 0            | 0               |
| 13-15 | +1           | 0               |
| 16-18 | +2           | +1              |

Additionally, Strength can grant or deprive carry capacity.

See the following chart for the carry capacity modifier.

| Score | Carry Modifer (pounds) |
|:-----:|:----------------------:|
| 3-4   | -10                    |

| 7-15  | 0                      |
| 13-15 | +5                     |
| 16-18 | +10                    |

Strength is the prime attribute for Fighters.
