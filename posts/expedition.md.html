(insert ../header.md.html here)

# Introduction

This is a ruleset based on the rules of the original fantasy RPG, with modifications and additions for play in arctic or antarctic environments. 
These rules should tell you how to play the game, though rulings by the Referee will be necessary for all the important details not included here.

I'm going to assume you are familiar with the original game.
The main changes here are to simplify and accomodate the survival rules and heat retention rules.

Want to save these rules? Saving the raw html works well (though you will need internet for the saved page to render).
You may also download a stand--alone html file [here](https://rpgs.quajzen.page/posts/expedition.md.html?export).
That includes all but the background image and my font choice.
You could also print the page to pdf, this works well.

# Character Creation

To start, roll 3d6 6 times, and keep track of the order of the results.
Then assign those results in order to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma ability scores.
The implications of those scores are explained in Section [Ability Scores].

Now roll 1d6.
This is how many hitpoints you have.
It may be modified based on your Constitution score and class.

Choose a character class; this determines your skills in and out of combat by fitting you with a broad fantasy archetype.
You may interpret the archetype as you like and as fits with the campaign being played.
A list of classes is in Section [Character Classes].

Roll 3d6, then multiply the result by 10. 
This is how much gold you have to begin with.
You can purchase equipment listed in Section [Adventuring Equipment] and cold weather gear in Section [Outdoor Survival].


# Ability Scores

Your scores in an ability have various boons and detriments they influence.
See each below for a detailed description.

Additionally, each class has a prime requisite ability score. 
Meeting or exceeding that score grants experience bonus (in a percentage modifier).
On a 15+ for a prime requisite, you gain 5% bonus experience.
You also gain an additional 5% experience for each of a Wisdom of 15+ or Charisma of 15+.

In case of emergency, players may roll a saving throw related to a specific ability.
To do so, roll a d20. 
On a roll equal or under the score of the relevant ability, the player gets their way; otherwise, the GM imposes consequences.

All ability scores (except intelligence) use the same tables for determination of their relavant bonuses:

| Ability Score | Roll Bonus |
|:-------------:|:----------:|
| 3-8           | -1         |
| 9-12          | 0          |
| 13-18         | +1         |

| Ability Score | Extra Count |
|:-------------:|:-----------:|
| 3-8           | 0           |
| 9-12          | +1          |
| 13-18         | +2          |


## Strength

For Fighter class only, strength gives an extra bonus on the to-hit roll and damage.
Use the Roll Bonus table to determine the bonus.
Strength gives everyone extra inventory slots; use the Extra Count Table to determine how many extra inventory slots.

Strength is the prime attribute for Fighters.

## Dexterity

Dexterity offers or detracts from ranged weapon attacks.
Use the Roll Bonus table to determine the to-hit roll and damage roll bonuses.

## Constitution

Constitution modifes the health received from hit die.
This applies to each and every hit dice roll.
Use the Roll Bonus table.

## Intelligence

Intelligence grants possible ability to learn other languages.
Use the Extra Count table to determine how many more languages you can learn.

## Wisdom

Wisdom is the prime requisite for clerics.


## Charisma

Charisma grants the ability to hire special professionals. 
Use the Extra Count table to determine how many.

# Character Classes

Each player character has an alignment: Civilized or Cold-born.
Some straddle the two, but this is rare.

All classes use a d6 for hit die.

Everyone starts at level 1 and advances by gaining gold (1 XP/GP). Retire your character at level 6.

# Combat & Inventory

Each side of combat rolls 1d6 every round, higher roll goes first for that round.
Players may take a big action and move an appropriate distance.

Hitpoints are naturally recovered at 1/day.

Character can usually carry 8-10 items. Big items take 2 slots, small items can bundle into a single slot.

# Outdoor Survival

## Overview

Players track *heat points,* which diminish over time in the cold and outside. 
They are diminished with a HD roll per time period of overland travel (usually a watch of 4 hours); the roll may be modified by outdoor conditions or a character's constitution score.
The total amount of heat points is determined by a character's *heat capacity,* which is determined by the warm clothing worn.
Without restoring them in a tavern or other civilized structure, players may camp and build fire outdoors as outlined in Section [Camping].

There is also guidelines on snowfall accumulation and weather.
Snowfall is season--dependent and accumulated over successive days.
This affects travel and outdoor exposure rolls.
Players can get weather forecasts from locals, but the forecasts have a chance of being wrong.

## Heat

Start off by keeping track of players' heat capacity and heat points.
A typical item of cold--weather clothing grants 2-8 HD worth of heat capacity (i.e. 12--48 heat capacity).
Some sample items are given below:

| Clothing Item              | Heat Capacity | Cost  |
|:--------------------------:|:-------------:|:-----:|
| Warm Coat                  | 2 HD          | 20 gp |
| Insulated Inner Layer      | 4 HD          | 15 gp |
| Insulated hat/gloves/boots | 2 HD          | 5 gp  |
| Heavy Parka                | 8 HD          | 40 gp |


Every watch spent outdoors in the elements, make an exposure roll (d6), modified by outdoor conditions as outlined in Section [Weather].
That many heat points at lost.
When all heat points are lost, take 1 hitpoint of damage every watch.

At the Referee's discretion, they may apply a cold weather mishap.
Use the following table for inspiration.

| Starts with...       | Progresses to...     |
|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|
| Numbness             | Frostbite            |
| Shivering            | Hypothermia          |
| Itchiness            | Trench Foot          |
| Wet Layer            | Compromised Clothing |
| Loss of Coordination | Dropped Item         |
| Chapped Skin         | Open Wound           |


## Camping

There are three components to camping: shelter, fire, and food.

For shelter, determine if the shelter type meets the following criteria, then take note of the bonuses.

| Feature        | Bonus |
|:--------------:|:-----:|
| Blocks wind    | +1    |
| Insulates heat | +2    |

Fire can only be built on solid ground (not on top of snow), and in environments where there is dry wood.
In such environments, each player can spend an hour collecting d6 hours worth of firewood.
Fire provides a +1 bonus per 2 hours.

Food can be cooked on fire if available.
Warm, cooked food provides a +1 bonus.

The total of your bonuses are added to a roll of all HD worth of heat capacity.
That many heat points are restored.

Cold--weather gear and shelter types can be seen in the table below.

| Item           | Cost |
|:--------------:|:----:|
| Ice Axe        | 20   |
| Snow Shoes     | 2    |
| Insulated Tent | 30   |
| Igloo          | ---  |



## Weather

Roll weather for every 2 day period.
Roll a d6 for wind.

|   | Wind Strength | Exposure Roll Modifier |
|:-:|---------------|:-----------------------|
| 1 | Gusty         | +2                     |
| 2 | Gusty         | +2                     |
| 3 | Windy         | +1                     |
| 4 | Windy         | +1                     |
| 5 | Calm          | 0                      |
| 6 | Calm          | 0                      |

There is an additional exposure modifier of +1 at night.

Roll d12-8 for the two--day snowfall. 
Modify the result by the following table.
This is the inches over the period.

| Condition      | Snowfall Modifier | Exposure Modifier |
|:--------------:|-------------------|:------------------|
| Summer         | 0                 | 0                 |
| Spring/Fall    | +2                | +1                |
| Winter         | +4                | +2                |
| High Elevation | +4                | +2                |

If working with a calendar, roll d12 and use the chart to determine the season.
Start a campaign at the beginning of a season, for simplicity, using the previous season's average snowfall to start the snow accumulation.

|       | Season | Avg. Season Snowfall |
|:-----:|--------|:--------------------:|
| 1-3   | Winter | 112"                 |
| 4-6   | Spring | 22"                  |
| 7-9   | Summer | All snow melts       |
| 10-12 | Fall   | 22"                  |

Snowfall affects travel according to the following table.
The effects are cumulative.

| Travel Condition | Speed Multiplier                                       |
|:----------------:|:------------------------------------------------------:|
| Off-Road         | x0.5                                                   |
| Snowy            | x2/3 per 12" of snow (or x1 with snow-specific travel) |
| > 48"            | Impossible without snow-specific travel                |

Snow specific travel may include the following: Snow shoes, toboggan sled (for hauling), skis, or a sled dog team.
