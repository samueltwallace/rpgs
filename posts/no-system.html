<p>Let’s say we’re playing an FKR–style game. What system should we
use?</p>
<p>What’s wrong with this question?</p>
<h1 id="establish-setting-not-system">Establish Setting, not System</h1>
<p>FKR gameplay is all about holding true to in–world logic and genre
expectations. It’s not about <a
href="https://aboleth-overlords.com/2021/08/11/fkr-its-not-the-amount-of-rules/">no
rules</a>, but about <a
href="https://d66kobolds.blogspot.com/2021/04/how-i-run-and-play-ultralight-game.html">playing
worlds</a> instead. We additionally do, or at least something I want out
of this playstyle, is to have radically different gamefeels for
different worlds – a historical caravan game should feel much more
grindy and slow than high fantasy adventure. Similarly, a trained
warrior should have different damage resolution than machine gun spray.
So why are universal systems the norm?</p>
<p>Universal systems offer nothing that model how the game world works.
They do nothing setting–specific. And as fun as it is to design systems,
having setting–agnostic systems should be a last resort. Maybe this is
due to the idea that we should build interesting worlds, and not focus
on system, or that more system means less focus on setting, but I don’t
take these as good reasons to not have a fleshed out system.</p>
<p>I also don’t think that having an elaborate system will allow
min–maxing. There are both simple and complex games which can’t be
min–maxed at all: rock, paper, scissors and chess being respective
examples.</p>
<h1 id="flipping-the-process">Flipping the Process</h1>
<p>What should we be doing? Designing interesting worlds, and backing it
up with appropriate mechanics. Say we want wild magic that has
unpredictable magical catastrophes. We can lift Maze Rats magical
catastrophes table, or even lift the Wild Magic table from 5e, or mix
and match these two. Do we want a troupe of trained warrior and their
battlemaster? Let’s lift Pathfinder’s action system, or design our own
similar system.</p>
<p>Please realize that I made mention of crunchy resolution systems to
counteract the idea that FKR needs to have as few rules as possible, but
this crunch are not necessary. Think about what kind of actions you want
to encourage and subvert, and make it worthwhile and rewarding to engage
in that way.</p>
<p>So let’s do an example.</p>
<h1 id="urban-fantasy-system">Urban Fantasy System</h1>
<p>Let’s do fantasy urban, a la <em>Perdido Street Station.</em> There’s
some magical effects that’s understood as a form of scientific study, a
variety of different inhabitant species, including bug–people and catcus
people, and the city is ruled by its seedy underbelly.</p>
<p>If we are getting into undercity brawls, I think I like a Tunnel
Goons type approach to combat, highly abstracted as blows go back and
forth, knives are pulled, etc. It also keeps the fights unpredictable
with a heavy die roll component. You might even be incined to swap out
2d6 for 1d12 for even more variability.</p>
<p>Character creation draws heavily upon the city features. Are you a
thug, from the slums by the river, or a haughty academic? Let’s have two
<em>upbringings:</em> high–class and low–born. These allow criminal
contacts and connections, respectively. These are NPC’s you know that
can provide services, favors, or whatever else you can convince them of.
Detail them in your character.</p>
<p>Species of characters have different strengths, physically and
otherwise. Bug–people have great situational awareness, while
cactus–people are excellent brawlers. Give advantages to these kinds of
situations.</p>
<p>Magical ability is a science. Let’s make it a crafting system,
perhaps? Collect the right ingredients and anyone is a wizard. You need
something magical as a power source, then a conduit for it. Here’s a
small sample of magical trinkets.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">Waterstone + doll = dancing droplet</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">Dragons’ firegland + silicon =
glass–shaper</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">Psyche Mushroom + hair of target =
mind–reader</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">Dandelion seed + mountain peak air =
instant meadow</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h1 id="the-focus-on-fiction">The Focus on Fiction</h1>
<p>Mechanics and systems are players’ way of interacting with the world
you have created – it should be interesting as well. Don’t let the focus
on setting mean you divorce your system from it.</p>
