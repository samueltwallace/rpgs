**Dark Forest Hexcrawl**

(insert ../header.md.html here)

Everyone loves a dark forest hexcrawl, right? Let's do one.


# Initial Concept


Some random inspiration when I think of this:

 - Mirkwood
 - Morytania
 - *Act V* of The Dear Hunter
 - The Black Forest in Germany
 - On that note, Grimm's fairy tales
 - Chimera Ant Arc of Hunter x Hunter
 
 
What do I want to be in the forest?

 - Decrepit, Derelict buildings
 - A 'old woods' region that is nearly pitch-black
 - Some old diety/demon/power
 - mutated forest beasties (six legged wolves, e.g.) and some weird plants too
 - Druid cults

What do I want to convey?

 - Nature is a mindless juggernaut, constantly evolving
 - Natural selection produces dangerous things to live a long time
 
How do I want to structure the game?

 - some sort of crawl (point or hex)
 - Simple and deadly combat
 - risky and dangerous magic
 - eventual corruption by forest (Weird North corruption mechanic?)
 
# First Designs

 - Hexcrawl seems good; needs to fit with mission of PCs
 - Adventure hooks:
   - 10,000 gp in debt and given a last chance: hunt down renegade in forest or go to jail.
   - Caravan guards
   - Hunting for rare pelts/plants etc.
 - in a valley between two moutain ranges - nobody has explored all of it.
   - procedurally generated? - YES YES YES
 - System: Tunnel Goons + spells + herbalism + corruption
 
 
 
# Hex Tables
