**Dark Forest Hexcrawl**

(insert ../header.md.html here)

Everyone loves a dark forest hexcrawl, right? Let's do one.


# Initial Concept


Some random inspiration when I think of this:

 - Mirkwood
 - Morytania
 - *Act V* of The Dear Hunter
 - The Black Forest in Germany
 - On that note, Grimm's fairy tales
 - Chimera Ant Arc of *Hunter x Hunter*
 - *Over the Garden Wall*
 
 
What do I want to be in the forest?

 - Decrepit, Derelict buildings
 - A 'old woods' region that is nearly pitch-black
 - Some old diety/demon/power
 - mutated forest beasties (six legged wolves, e.g.) and some weird plants too
 - Druid cults

What do I want to convey?

 - Nature is a mindless juggernaut, constantly evolving
 - Natural selection produces dangerous things to live a long time
 
How do I want to structure the game?

 - some sort of crawl (point or hex)
 - Simple and deadly combat
 - risky and dangerous magic
 - eventual corruption by forest (Weird North corruption mechanic?)
 
# First Designs

 - Hexcrawl seems good; needs to fit with mission of PCs
 - Adventure hooks:
   - 10,000 gp in debt and given a last chance: hunt down renegade in forest or go to jail.
   - Caravan guards
   - Hunting for rare pelts/plants etc.
 - in a valley between two moutain ranges - nobody has explored all of it.
   - procedurally generated? - YES YES YES
 - System: Tunnel Goons + spells + herbalism + corruption
 
# System Additions

Use Tunnel Goons' [standard rules](https://tunnelgoons.com/srd) as usual. In addition, here's how to handle other possible consequences you might want to impose:


 - __PCs Save vs Spell Effect__: Set a DS (foe's HP works), and roll. If below DS, take damage equal to difference. If you roll above, take and deal no damage.
 - __PCs save vs Trap__: Set a DS for the trap, and roll. If below DS, take damage equal to difference. If you roll above, take and deal no damage.
 - __Group Attacks__: For each extra ally on a side of the combat, add +1 to either the foes' DS or the frontman's roll. Remember to keep combat 1 on 1.
 - __Casting a Spell__: For most spells, they 'just happen.' If under duress, roll +erudite to recall/perform spell actions.
 
 
## Spell List


Compile/choose spells from the following lists:

 - [108 Level-less spells](https://dreamingdragonslayer.itch.io/108-level-less-spells-d366)
 - [Cairn Spellbooks](https://cairnrpg.com/resources/more-spellbooks/)
 - [Cairn Standard Spells](https://cairnrpg.com/cairn-srd/#100-spells)
 - [Cairn Relics](https://cairnrpg.com/resources/more-relics/)
 
 
 
For damage of a spell (if applicable), treat as if it were a combat roll, add +erudite plus any relevant items (magical trinkets, e.g.).

Spells are usually stored in a physical medium, like a book, scroll, or item, and might have a limited usage. Spell scrolls only work once, and relics have charges that require a special recharge. GM decides recharge. 

Creating a spellbook requires a ritual writing the entire night of a full moon, as well as skill in transcribing and knowledge of magical things. Usually done by the strange wizards.
