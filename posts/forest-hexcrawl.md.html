**Dark Forest Hexcrawl**

(insert ../header.md.html here)

Everyone loves a dark forest hexcrawl, right? Let's do one.


# Initial Concept


Some random inspiration when I think of this:

 - Mirkwood
 - Morytania
 - *Act V* of The Dear Hunter
 - The Black Forest in Germany
 - On that note, Grimm's fairy tales
 - Chimera Ant Arc of *Hunter x Hunter*
 - *Over the Garden Wall*
 
 
What do I want to be in the forest?

 - Decrepit, Derelict buildings
 - A 'old woods' region that is nearly pitch-black
 - Some old diety/demon/power
 - mutated forest beasties (six legged wolves, e.g.) and some weird plants too
 - Druid cults

What do I want to convey?

 - Nature is a mindless juggernaut, constantly evolving
 - Natural selection produces dangerous things to live a long time
 
How do I want to structure the game?

 - some sort of crawl (point or hex)
 - Simple and deadly combat
 - risky and dangerous magic
 - eventual corruption by forest (Weird North corruption mechanic?)
 
# First Designs

 - Hexcrawl seems good; needs to fit with mission of PCs
 - Adventure hooks:
   - 10,000 gp in debt and given a last chance: hunt down renegade in forest or go to jail.
   - Caravan guards
   - Hunting for rare pelts/plants etc.
   - Follow the Bones quest generation
 - in a valley between two moutain ranges - nobody has explored all of it.
   - procedurally generated? - YES YES YES
 - System: Tunnel Goons + spells + herbalism + corruption

# Introduction

*The Mabinog Valley is deeply shaded and very deep. It has been explored around the edges, but there are no definitive maps of it. Natives and area locals know that there is very little to be found there: razorvine produces no fruit and the valley walls too steep to make an efficient logging route... yet this is not the reason they stay away. There are things deep in the valley, where light has never touched, that are, against all impression, deeply natural. This valley has taught that nature is a vicious and voracious thing to be feared, not a pastoral or idyllic process. Thus, it is all but avoided except by the bravest of explorers. Would you be one of them? What business brings you to the valley?*
 
# System Additions

Use Tunnel Goons' [standard rules](https://tunnelgoons.com/srd) as usual. In addition, here's how to handle other possible consequences you might want to impose:


 - __PCs Save vs Spell Effect__: Set a DS (foe's HP works), and roll. If below DS, take damage equal to difference. If you roll above, take and deal no damage.
 - __PCs save vs Trap__: Set a DS for the trap, and roll. If below DS, take damage equal to difference. If you roll above, take and deal no damage.
 - __Group Attacks__: For each extra ally on a side of the combat, add +1 to either the foes' DS or the frontman's roll. Remember to keep combat 1 on 1.
 - __Casting a Spell__: For most spells, they 'just happen.' If under duress, roll +erudite to recall/perform spell actions.
 - __Chases & Retreats__: Roll +skulker to get a lead, succeed by 3 or more to lose your pursuer.
 
 
## Spell List


Compile/choose spells from the following lists:

 - [108 Level-less spells](https://dreamingdragonslayer.itch.io/108-level-less-spells-d366)
 - [Cairn Spellbooks](https://cairnrpg.com/resources/more-spellbooks/)
 - [Cairn Standard Spells](https://cairnrpg.com/cairn-srd/#100-spells)
 - [Cairn Relics](https://cairnrpg.com/resources/more-relics/)
 
 
 
For damage of a spell (if applicable), treat as if it were a combat roll, add +erudite plus any relevant items (magical talisman, e.g.).

Spells are usually stored in a physical medium, like a book, scroll, or item, and might have a limited usage. Spell scrolls only work once, and relics have charges that require a special recharge. GM decides recharge. 

Creating a spellbook requires a ritual writing the entire night of a full moon, as well as skill in transcribing and knowledge of magical things. Usually done by the strange wizards.

# Location Generation

Keep track of the party's elevation, which ranges 1-12. After reaching a feature, they may decide to **ascend**, **descend**, or **keep elevation**.
