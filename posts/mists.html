<p>There is a place many have seen but few remember. Most memories of
that place are remembered as dreams, and seem distant and indistinct,
leaving vague impressions that kids call nightmares but adults brush
off. Children cry about scary monsters, places, and nonsensical event
sequences, but most of all they remember feeling lost, alone, and
abandoned. Parents take in these kids, and comfort them until they fall
back asleep peacefully again.</p>
<p>However, there are people who remember more than this, and for far
longer than just childhood. These memories tend to be more distinct,
often featuring multiple dream sequences over the course of a night.
These victims visit therapists, psychiatrists, psychologists, take
medication, partake in sleep studies, and take on cognitive training
strategies. Nothing is ever seen to science as abnormal in the brain or
physiology of the patients. But at some point or another, a dream occurs
or recurs, and the process of doctor visits begins anew.</p>
<p>The most successful cases have been resolved primarily through
cognitive training. The training mostly consists of learning to
forcefully forget the disturbing visions, or to self–calm when the
victims suddenly remember in the middle of the day. These are the most
successful cases, but the worst cases can lead to diagnoses that lead to
an inability to lead a normal life, sometimes requiring
institutionalization or imprisonment. No matter how well the patient is
able to manage the memories, there is a consistent element: thick
mist.</p>
<p>The details of the dreams vary between people. Some remember being in
an abandoned city, skyscapers disappearing quickly into the thick mist.
Others are in forests, or perhaps on the plains, but not much is visible
in these dreams. The sequences often take place across several of these
settings. The witnessed events in these dreams are witnessed suddenly as
one walks through the mist. They are often horrifying, two faced persons
or gargantuan malformed beasts. Sometimes they are undertaking
horrendous tasks, but sometimes they simply stare back at the patient.
It is hard to say which has a greater effect on the victims.</p>
<p>While these dreams do correlate with childhood trauma, it is unclear
how they relate. Do the dreams cause disruptive behavior that beget
trauma, or do they spring from the trauma experienced beforehand? In any
case, the link is undeniable. The presence of these dreams are nearly
indicative of a person struggling with demons.</p>
<p>These are not all isolated people experiencing this phenomena. They
find each other, especially in a connected modern world, but rarely does
anything good come of the meetings. These meetings are awkward, touchy,
and sometimes self–destructive. There have been groups of these
dreamers, meeting to commit crimes, delve into the occult, wallow in
misery together, or end themselves after coming face to face with the
dispirited image of a kindred soul. The most common outcome of these
meetings is the joint conclusion that their dreams are real. There is a
place, a dimension, beyond consciousness, that they are transported to
mentally, after sleep. This almost inevitably leads to a program of
preventing sleep within the group, to prevent the dreams. This only
worsens their mental state, but the stress of the nightmares seems more
evil to them. Regardless, these meetings never improve these patients’
state.</p>
<p>Some of the afflicted never seek help. They simply live. That is not
to say the experiences are not harrowing to them, but they hypothesize
and develop conspiracies of their affliction to cope. They lurk in dark
places, where they wouldn’t be found or bothered by doctors or those who
would help. The dreams are harrowing indeed, but they are more than that
to these. They are understood as showing a true nature of reality. The
death, decay, and dismemberment is seen as representative of how the
world works, under a facade. Therefore these dreams are embraced. These
dreamers see themselves as truth seekers, and these disturbing visions
as the true way forward. The grandiosity of this viewpoint is beyond my
understanding, but these are for sure the most dangerous of the
dreamers.</p>
<p>I have not found much in the way of relief from these dreams. I visit
doctors when I have the urge, and they run tests, and talk to me; the
therapists get more personal details from my past, but nothing ever
comes of it to alieve my dreams. It is good company to have. It feels
nice to have the spotlight, to know people are paying attention to you,
that they have some vested interest in your well–being. But mostly I
don’t care anymore. The dreams come and go, and my vitality ebb with the
dreams, but I take it in stride. I have met others, but they are too
caught up in an agenda to have a coherent conversation. So now, I
suppose, I will just wait to fade away, when I have nothing left in me,
when I am an empty husk, and my bodily functions slow to a small,
graceful death.</p>
