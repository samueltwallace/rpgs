(insert ../header.md.html here)

This is information on playing in a historically--based Medieval Scandinavian RPG that should help inform players on making characters.

# Common Knowledge of the World

 - **Life is hard.** You live in the furthest reaches of the North, and the cold and snow create many difficult aspects of life.
 - **Magic is real but is unseen.** Magic makes up the fabric of the world, but few have ever seen explicit workings of it. Words and runic writing is intimately conneted to the practice.
 - **Many creatures stalk the night.** Trolls, elves, and other land spirits exist, but avoid humans if they can avoid it.
 - **Foreigners bring strange things.** Their religion, their magics, their tales, are all strange and unknowable.

# Creating a Character

You might be inspired by one of the classic archetypes of this culture: berserker raiders, skalds, or seers. Or you may choose to be a free man, a karl, who by choice or circumstance has ventured from home. 

Create an evocative name for your character. You may choose a name of the format "[Name] The [Descriptor]." You then get any specific traits for your name. If you don't have any ideas, roll on Cairn tables for a name and a virtue.

You may take any gear that makes sense for your character, and as allowed by the referee. You can probably hold 4 non-worn items. 

You start with 4 hits, add more depending on your traits or gear (e.g. armor). 

# Things You Could Do

As a player in a setting like this, you might:

 - explore the lair of some foul beast
 - explore ruins left by past raids
 - seek out a wizard to perform divination magic.
