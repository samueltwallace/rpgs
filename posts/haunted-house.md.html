![The HOUSE](../media/haunted_house.jpg)


This is a system--agnostic dungeon for classic scares in a spooky old house.

This adventure is system agnostic: it has no stats associated to each combat-able enemy, but instead a *threat level.* Threat levels range from 1 to 5, with a threat level 1 indicating that this NPC is disposed of quite easily, and a threat level 5 indicating a nigh--impossible combat challenge.

You will have to do some work to fit this to your system. Threat levels are only a bare-bones scale of difficulty. Looking for a system? Try [Tunnel Goons](https://tunnelgoons.com/)! Convert monsters by doubling the threat level and adding 3, then use that for a Dfficulty Score.

You also need to come up with an adventure hook. Possibilities include:

 - A friend has ventured into mansion several days ago and not returned
 - The manor is known to be home the riches of old money
 - The party has heard rumors of the Cult of the Black Eye and wants to cash in on any reward.

All of the maps in this adventure are converted from ASCII diagrams. You need a legend for some of the text symbols I use.


| Symbol | Feature           |
|:-------|:------------------|
| $      | Secret Door       |
| #      | Trap/Hazard       |
| o      | Point of Interest |

I often refer to places on the map by relative directions (top left, right, etc.). These are relative to the map *as drawn*: top left means top left in the map, right wall is on the right side of the map, etc.


# Overview

This adventure takes place in a deserted house on a hill. There are several things going on in this house:

 - A cult has taken up residence in the excavated basement, trying to summon a demon
 - A humanoid monstrosity has been living in the mausoleum in the family plot
 - The ghosts of the former residents of the house reenact scenes from their life
 - Sentient books talk endlessly in their prison of a library
 - A collection of statues in the attic move just when out of sight

There are other smaller encounters throughout the house: grave goblins have been feeding on the bodies in the family plot; a pack of wolves stalk the grounds, keeping intruders out and captives in; and a greenhouse of hungry, carnivorous plants emit sweet scents to attract the easily fooled.

## House Background


The house is a small mansion set on a hill, the family home of the prosperous **Larvus family.** A merchant family of the local area, they rose to wealth long ago, and after several generations, dark things came into play. The last patriarch of the family fathered a bastard with a maid, but this child was not normal.

The maid, Theresa, was a member of the **Cult of the Black Eye** and was trying to summon a demon. Wendell, the bastard, was the result. Hideously deformed and with a hunger abnormal for any other baby, he was a menace to the other children and the household. When Theresa's dark alliance came to be known, the family imploded. 

Hired help fled the house, and the family was left alone. Cult members returned and attempted to take Wendell from the family, ending in a bloody mess. The whole family was killed, but Wendell escaped his captors with demonic strength. He eventually fled into the surrounding woods, only to return again into the family mausoleum.

In the time between the tragic downfall of the Larvus family and when the party arrives, the abandoned mansion has fallen into disrepair and attracted scavengers, like the grave goblins and the wolves.

[Grounds of the Larvus Manor]

The grounds are patrolled by **Wolves** (threat level 1). They do not enter the house, but will chase down anyone outside on the grounds. They are in the vicinity of the party on a 2-in-6 chance. They appear in packs of 2d4.

In the grave plot, **Grave Goblins** (threat level 1) are munching on the bones of past Larvuses. They have keen noses and are attracted to meat that is spoiled or worse. They are defensive of their new meal, but don't venture far from it.


The Greenhouse contains 3 rows of overgrown carnivorous plants. The plants snap at anyone that gets too close, or ensnare with their overflowing roots. They individually have a threat level of 2. On the wall opposite the entrance, the key to the basement is hanging on a hook.

[Ground Floor of the Larvus Manor]

1. **Foyer**: This small room has dusty coat racks, old paintings, and peeling wallpaper. A staircase in the top right corner leads upstairs. A pile of debris sits just inside the door, under a collapsed ceiling.
2. **Dining Room**: A large table with plates of long-rotted food dominates this room. 
3. **Living Room**: Paintings of past Larvuses decorate the walls (with nameplates). There is a large fireplace and several formerly-expensive chairs as well.
4. **Kitchen**: Big wooden tables, shelves, and kitchen utensils are pushed against the wall. There is an initially locked trapdoor to the basement. The key is in the greenhouse. The backdoor in this room has been broken in.
5. **Library and Study**: This study has shelves along the wall. The books talk and can communicate sensibly, though they can only hear voices. They only seem to be interested in the topic they are about. There are books on architecture, anatomy, foreign languages, science, anthropology, and the Larvus family history.

The rooms have the remains of Horace, Lily, and Jacob, and older relatives. The lower crypt is where **Wendell** (threat level 5) is living. He is a deformed humanoid with superhuman strength and speed. He hates light, but is very lonely. He came back to the manor to see what was left of his old family. Now he sits in the mausoleum bemoaning his own fate. Wendell knows of the grave goblins, and wants them driven off from his family's remains.


# First Floor


The first floor features ghost encounters with the dead Larvus family. These ghost encounters are entirely atmospheric; the ghosts are not substantial enough to be fought. This entire floor is unnaturally cold.

[First Floor of the Larvus Manor]

1. **Drawing Room**: Where the Larvuses would entertain their guests. There are several loveseats and chairs around a small table. 
2. **Collapsed Hallway**: This hallway is mostly collapsed. It's too far for any normal person to jump. A chandelier hangs from the ceiling here.
3. **Children's Playroom**: Scattered old toys lie on the floor here. A staircase in the top left corner leads up to the attic.
4. **Children's Bedroom**: 4 small beds and more toys are in this room. One of the beds is across the room from the others; it was Wendell's.
5. **Master Bedroom**: A moldy four-poster bed is in the center of the room. An empty vanity stands next to a dresser against the wall. The two doors to this room are locked; the key is in the statue gallery.
6. **Balcony**: The greenhouse can be seen from the balcony.
7. **Safe**: A safe built into the wall contains important documents and jewelry. The passcode is lost to time.

## Ghost Encounters

Ghostly encounters are triggered as the party moves through this floor. The scenes play in a specific order, in the room numbering order on the map. If the rooms are ventured out of order before the scenes have all played out, then some spooky thing happens (ghostly wail, levitating objects, etc.).

1. Lloyd and Cora sit together entertaining guests. They politely converse, their voices now distorted whispers. After a moment, Lloyd walks through the door to the hall.
2. Lloyd is kissing Theresa in the hallway (supernaturally floating above the collapsed floor). Theresa shoves him off and heads for the kids' playroom. 
3. Baby Wendell (already deformed) is sitting on the floor alone, crying. 
4. Robert, Edith, and Pearl taunting and bullying Wendell. Lloyd enters the room from the master bedroom (walking through the locked door), calms the situation, and leaves again through the door.
5. Lloyd and Cora fighting in an intense argument. Cora heads for the balcony in rage. 
6. A small crowd of hooded figures holding torches is approaching the house.

[Top Floor of the Larvus Manor]


1. **Servant's Quarters**: A few small beds with footlockers are arranged around the room. 
2. **Statue Gallery**: A dozen or so statues and mannequins are posing around the room. The statues and mannequins are animated, but can only move when not in line of sight. They cannnot move outside of the room. The animated objects have threat level 3; they can take damage. On the floor in the bottom right corner is the key to the master bedroom.

1. **Cellar Pantry**: Shelves of preserved food line the earthen walls. A small archway leads in the wine cellar. Stairs in the upper left lead back up to the kitchen.
2. **Wine Cellar**: There are wine racks along the right wall of this room. Many wine bottles are smashed on the ground; the racks are mostly empty. Behind the center racks is a thin wooden sheet blocking a tunnel (the "$" on the map). Under the "o" is where Cora's jewelry is buried in a small bag; there is a small mound of dirt piled up on top.
3. **Earthen Tunnel**: There are several **tripwire traps** (# on the map) that will trigger a ceiling collapse.
4. **Cave**: **The Cult of the Black Eye** is digging in this room, looking for Wendell, who they refer to as "The Son." They can magically sense his presence, and have been following the signal like a compass. Remains of recent rituals are visible on the floor (dried blood, ritual circles in the dirt). The cultists have a threat level of 3.
