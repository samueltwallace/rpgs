 - Least complicated rolling system.
 - Encourage in-world ("narrative") advancement and consequences (as opposed to mechanical).
 - Use dice-rolling to abstract important actions as little as possible.

Players have 3 stats: Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), and Acumen (ACU). These all get assigned a bonus, ranging from +1 to +6, and is generated by rolling 2d6 and assigning bonuses that total to the lowest of the two rolls, with any individual bonus being no more than +3. Players use the 'lowest of the two rolls' to generate how many inventory slots they have. Only track inventory for bulky items. Generate or assign currency as seems appropriate to desired setting, characters, and tone.

Player characters, throughout play, will encounter dangerous or risky situations and need to act quickly, or they may need to resolve contested actions (against other characters or the environment). Players will roll a 'saving throw' to resolve this. These are only necessary when there is a clear and present risk, danger, or constraint that prevents a clear success or failure.

Roll a saving throw of a relevant stat by rolling 2d6 and adding an appropriate stat modifier. If the result is 10 or greater, the player character succeeds. If a 10 seems too high, have them automatically succeed at an alternative resource cost (e.g. time, pose a hard bargain). If a 10 seems too easy, make it impossible for the player character.

Examples of situations to roll saves:
 - Acting before someone else in a fight (DEX)
 - Surviving extreme environmental effect (STR)
 - Translate an alien language (ACU)

Track damage with hitpoints. Each player character starts with 2d6 hitpoints, and an armor value of 6. When damage is rolled for a hit, first subtract from the armor value from the damage, then subtract the result from hit points. If you drop to 0, you are incapacitated and barely hanging on for life. If you drop below 0, you die.

To roll damage, roll 2d6 and add STR stat bonus for a melee attack, and DEX stat bonus for a ranged attack. 

On ANY 2d6 roll, if doubles are rolled, the consequences of action are modified. Doubles on a success exceeds the original goal, giving additional benefits and advantages. Doubles on a failure are catastrophic.

Characters may have effects, items, backstories, and powers beyond the actions stated here. The GM should award additional proficiences, powers, and possibilities as fits the setting and genre.

title: Prep:

Choose a setting whose usual characters, scenarios, and tropes are familiar to you. Sketch a small map of a starting location. Write 5-10 bullet points about encounters which would be cool. Don't label the map. Create characters and distribute items to them as fits the setting and character; use supplementary material as much as needed.

1. GM describes the situation fully, clarifying freely if necessary.
2. Players describe the actions they wish to take, clarifying their means to do so if necessary. Roll only if outcome is entirely unclear.
3. GM describes a logical response to the action, inserting complications, advancements, or other developments as seems cool.

Repeat.

title: Advice:

 - Prep as little as possible to enable maximum flexibility. Be full of cool ideas, not pre-planned plots.
 - Don't get in the way of players' cool ideas. If something is plausible, let it happen. 
 - If something is cool, consequential, or mission-critical, get into as much detail as possible about how it happens. Don't let it boil down to one roll.
 - Make obstacles difficult via hard choices and dilemmas, not by rolling.
