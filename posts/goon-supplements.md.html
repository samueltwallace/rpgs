(insert ../header.md.html here)

Want to play Tunnel Goons, but looking for supplemental materials flavor, setting, or general inspiration? I've collected some system--neutral (or sometimes just easily transferrable) lists of gear, spells or tech, and player powers to augment your game.

# Fantasy

## Magic

 - [108 Level-less Spells](https://dreamingdragonslayer.itch.io/108-level-less-spells-d366)
 - [More Spellbooks](https://cairnrpg.com/resources/more-spellbooks/) (many more links at bottom of page)
 - [Maze Rats Magic](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/197158/Maze-Rats)
 - [Old School Stylish](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/375243/Old-School-Stylish--Classless-DiscoveryBased-Advancement) (discovery-based power progression -- see also [Foreground Growth](https://www.bastionland.com/2016/05/foreground-growth-and-becoming-odd.html?m=1))


How does magic work in your world, both in--fiction and mechanically? A sensible and straightforward way to implement rolling is rolling a +erudite roll to an action roll if a roll is deemed appropriate for the situation. Is magic in your world innate, or external? Natural or crafted? Do you need components, a spellbook, or does it come as a bottled potion?

## Gear & Character Backgrounds

 - [Cairn Equipment](https://cairnrpg.com/resources/more-equipment/)
 - [Weird North](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/324238/Weird-North?src=hottest_filtered) (Conan-esque fantasy)

## Worldbuilding

 - [Kill the God-Emperor](https://wizard-lizard.itch.io/kill-the-god-emperor) (High fantasy)
 - [Caers and Crannogs](https://manarampmatt.itch.io/caers-crannogs-issue-1) (Fairy-tale Fantasy)
 - [Mausritter Faction Progression](https://mausritter.com/) (Sandbox creation)
 - [Beneath the Canals](https://michaeltlombardi.itch.io/beneath-the-canals) (micro-setting)
 - [Bardiche](https://wizard-lizard.itch.io/bardiche-a-dark-fantasy-adventure-for-24xx) (micro-setting & adventure prompt)
 
If you are needing inspiration, lay out a desired theme, tone, and scope (I suggest getting out a thesaurus for the first two - a more specific word is better than 'dark fantasy'). Think about creature types, their rarity, behavior, and interrelations.

# Sci-Fi/Science Fantasy

## Gear & Tech

 - [24xx](https://jasontocci.itch.io/24xx) (gear list, skills, backgrounds and origins)
 - [Vaults of Vaarn](https://vaarn.github.io/#/) (gear lists, exotica, ancestries, transport)
 - [Traveller Gear](https://www.traveller-srd.com/core-rules/equipment/) (gear)

What's the tech level you want to have? Plasma rifles or pocket AI? How is gear repaired if damaged? Is it far too advanced to be repaired by the players, or advanced enough to repair itself?

## Worldbuilding

 - [Traveller World Creation](https://www.traveller-srd.com/core-rules/world-creation/)
 - [Stars Without Number](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/230009/Stars-Without-Number-Revised-Edition-Free-Version?cPath=36869)
 
I haven't explored this topic a lot, would love suggestions.

# Player Powers

I think there is a well-known idea here: [Foreground Growth](https://www.bastionland.com/2016/05/foreground-growth-and-becoming-odd.html?m=1). In a nutshell, dangerous encounters teach you skills, skills that make sense for the encounter. See [Cairn FAQ](https://cairnrpg.com/resources/frequently-asked-questions/#how-do-pcs-advance-without-things-like-levels-or-xp) for examples.

Resources:

 - [Old School Stylish](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/375243/Old-School-Stylish--Classless-DiscoveryBased-Advancement)


But do not prep some generic list of cool powers and drop them in wherever. Make foreground growth extremely interrelated to all aspects of the game; the world, the encounter, the character's actions. A good example I like is in [Barrow of the Elf King](https://natetreme.itch.io/botek), where a deal is offered by a spider matron (not really a spoiler).

Principles for foreground growth:

 - offer something relevant to encounter
 - offer a serious buff
 - give it a costly drawback


# Other Resources

Itch and DriveThruRPG, by searching for supplements and/or system--agnostic, can turn up worthwhile results. The best inspiration, is of course, the media you love, with [the gameable DNA of it extracted](https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2014/07/how-to-be-creative-also-blobbins.html).
