**System Neutral Tunnel Goons Supplement Guide**

Want to play Tunnel Goons, but looking for supplemental materials flavor, setting, or general inspiration? I've collected some system--neutral (or sometimes just easily transferrable) lists of gear, spells or tech, and player powers to augment your game.

# Fantasy

## Magic

 - [108 Level-less Spells](https://dreamingdragonslayer.itch.io/108-level-less-spells-d366)
 - [More Spellbooks](https://cairnrpg.com/resources/more-spellbooks/) (many more links at bottom of page)
 - [Maze Rats Magic](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/197158/Maze-Rats)


How does magic work in your world, both in--fiction and mechanically? A sensible and straightforward way to implement rolling is rolling a +erudite roll to an action roll if a roll is deemed appropriate for the situation. Is magic in your world innate, or external? Natural or crafted? Do you need components, a spellbook, or does it come as a bottled potion?

## Worldbuilding

 - [Kill the God-Emperor](https://wizard-lizard.itch.io/kill-the-god-emperor) (High fantasy)
 - [Caers and Crannogs](https://manarampmatt.itch.io/caers-crannogs-issue-1) (Fairy-tale Fantasy)
 - [Mausritter Faction Progression](https://mausritter.com/) (Sandbox creation)
 - [Beneath the Canals](https://michaeltlombardi.itch.io/beneath-the-canals) (micro-setting)
 - [Bardiche](https://wizard-lizard.itch.io/bardiche-a-dark-fantasy-adventure-for-24xx) (micro-setting & adventure prompt)
 
If you are needing inspiration, lay out a desired theme, tone, and scope (I suggest getting out a thesaurus for the first two - a more specific word is better than 'dark'). Think about creature types, their rarity, behavior, and interrealations.

# Sci-Fi/Science Fantasy

## Gear & Tech

 - [24xx](https://jasontocci.itch.io/24xx) (gear list, skills, backgrounds and origins)
 - [Vaults of Vaarn](https://vaarn.github.io/#/) (gear lists, exotica, ancestries, transport)
 - [Traveller Gear](https://www.traveller-srd.com/core-rules/equipment/) (gear)

What's the tech level you want to have? Plasma rifles or pocket AI? How is gear repaired if damaged? Is it far too advanced to be repaired by the players, or advanced enough to repair itself?

## Worldbuilding

 - [Traveller World Creation](https://www.traveller-srd.com/core-rules/world-creation/)
 
I haven't explored this topic a lot, would love suggestions.
