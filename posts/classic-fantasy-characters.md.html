**Making a Classic Fantasy Character**

(insert ../header.md.html here)



# Setting

Decide on 'truths' of a classic fantasy setting. Expand each into 3-4 sentences for clarity and focus. An example of mine below:


 - **Explore a world of crusades and knights.** Play as any fitting archetype: a valiant knight, a strange magician, a cunning thief, even a street urchin. Build catapults and trebuchets, break sieges, and rescue fair maidens.
 - **Magic is rare but powerful.**  Lone wizards in their towers craft spells and enchantments that could ruin a kingdom. The approach of a dragon is seen once in a lifetime. Elves are rumored to only hide in the deepest depths of the forests.
 - **Descend into the ruins of ages past.** Old markers of past civilizations dot the landscape, providing opportunities for adventure. Ancient monasteries, ruined keeps, and deserted crypts may hide monsters, treasure, or both.
 - **Defend yourself against uncivilized lands.** The vast woods contain brigands and theives who would kill and rob you. Druids protect leylines an dconduct rituals ons stone daises. If you venturefar enough, you may see unicorns or demons. Tribes of barbarians form their camps as well.
 
 
 This sets expectations of what to expect of the world and its inhabitants.
 
 With this done, set up the following for players to prep characters.
 
 
# List Lifepaths

List at least 10 possible lifepaths for characters to choose from. These represent stations of life for a period of about 8 years (you begin at an age of 14). Lifepaths should be based on a profession or lifestyle; it should provide interesting skills, background, and connections to other parts of the world.

When a player rolls lifepath in their character's backstory, roll 2d6 to see what additional benefits or detriments occur during this time period. You must meet or exceed a roll of 7 plus ordered placement of the lifepath in the character's life. For instance, in the second lifepath period, you must meet or exceed 7 + 2 = 9. On a successful check, you gain a benefit, and on a failure you gain a detriment. Discuss with the referee to determine something appropriate.

Here are the lifepaths for my setting (roll 3d6):

3. **Librarian.** You are employed at an important library. What interesting things do you learn?
4. **Hermit.** You seclude yourself in the wilderness. What insights or inspiring experiences do you have?
5. **Odd Jobs.** You did odd jobs for people for some time. What was the task you felt worst about?
6. **Fisherman.** You hauled nets and cast line. What accident nearly cost you your life?
7. **Lumberjack.** You cut trees for a living. What's something about the forest only you know?
8. **Thief.** You stole many things. Which of your scores was the biggest?
9. **City Guard.** You protected the powerful and the weak. What criminal caused you the most trouble?
10. **Soldier.** You spent some time as a soldier, to your local lord or a mercenary company. What conflicts did you fight in, or not?
11. **Hunter.** You made a living through hunting. What is the biggest game you've brought in?
12. **Performer.** You learn a performance skill and spend time earning a living this way. Who do you meet while traveling, or how do you get yourself into trouble?
13. **Cartographer.** You make maps for a living. What exotic locales do you visit, and what do the locals think of you?
14. **Miner.** You did backbreaking work. What unexpected strength did you gain from the hard work?
15. **Craftsperson.** You develop a profession in a particular craft. What is it, and why does it work out for you, or not?
16. **Merchant.** You develop a burgeoning business of buying and selling. What interesting wares do you handle, or what trouble do you get into?
17. **Monk/Nun.** You join a cloister or abbey. What does your time there do for you?
18. **Addict.** You were hoplessly addicted to something common, or not. How did you recover?

Ask players to come up with a connection so that everyone has a connection to someone else at the table.

# Discuss Starting Gear and Equipment

Have players come up with 4-5 starting items. Start them with 3d6 gold. Decide on any particular abilities as well. 

# Discuss an Initial Hook

Have an open discussion about what seems fun, what kind of gameplay they want, and come up with a first adventure hook.
