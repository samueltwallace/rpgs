**Into the Mist**



There is a place many have seen but few remember. Most memories of that place are remembered as dreams, and seem distant and indistinct, leaving vague impressions that kids call nightmares but adults brush off. Children cry about scary monsters, places, and event sequences that make no sense, but most of all they remember feeling lost, alone, and abandoned. Parents take in these kids, and comfort them until they fall back asleep peacefully again.

However, there are people who remember more than this, and for far longer than just childhood. These memories tend to be more distinct, often featuring multiple dream sequences over the course of a night. These victims visit therapists, psychiatrists, psychologists, take medication, take part in sleep studies, and take on cognitive training strategies. Nothing is ever seen to science as abnormal in the brain or physiology of the patients. But at some point or another, a dream occurs or recurs, and the process of doctor visits begins anew.

The most successful cases have been resolved primarily through cognitive training. The training mostly consists of learning to forcefully forget the disturbing visions, or to self--calm when the victims suddenly remember in the middle of the day. These are the most successful cases, but the worst cases can lead to diagnoses that lead to an inability to lead a normal life, sometimes requiring institutionalization or imprisonment. No matter how well the patient is able to manage the memories, there is a consistent element: thick mist.

The details of the dreams vary between people. Some remember being in an abandoned city, skyscapers disappearing quickly into the thick mist. Others are in forests, or perhaps on the plains, but not much is visible in these dreams. The sequences often take place across several of these settings. The witnessed events in these dreams are witnessed suddenly as one walks through the mist.
