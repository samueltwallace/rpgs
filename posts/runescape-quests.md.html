**RuneScape Quests to Steal and Remix**

(insert ../header.md.html here)

RuneScape quests are among my favorites. Here are some summaries to steal for your RPG game. I'll give an overall summary of the quest premise, and how I would adapt it.


# Monkey Madness

My personal favorite. In this quest, you are recruited by the Gnome King on a military extraction mission, rescuing a special ops unit gone missing in the southern seas. When their last known coordinates are visited, you find out an intelligent monkey and ape society on an island has taken them prisoner. You also learn that they were sabotaged and there is a mole in the gnomish military.

## Adapting Monkey Madness

I think a hot start is appropriate for this. Start them en route to the island, getting a mission brief. Replace intelligent monkeys with something else as you please (bears are another good one). Then get into the stealthing around the island. A big part of the original quest is sneaking just out of sight in the high grass; make evasion and stealth possible. Put guards on a rotation if they get caught. 

An element you could include is the magical 'greegrees' of the quest, which transform you into a monkey while held. They can then get past monkeys, as long as they maintain grip of the greegree. You could do other ways of interacting with monkeys, such as social radicals who take the PCs under their wing. 

Play out the mole however you like. Is he on the island? Back at home base? What are his goals? 


# The Tale of the Muspah

A small quest that is often overlooked. A young man in the frozen north discovers a strange creature trapped in ice. He asks for help in freeing it. You find out it is more dangerous and horrifying than you expected...

## Adapting Tale of the Muspah

I like just the premise of this; seems ripe for many resolutions. While the original quest is tied to a lot of RuneScape lore, you should feel no need to do similar. This could be a small discovery, or it could escalate into a mustering of an army. A wizard far away may know its weakness. Or perhaps a legitimate horror is unleashed onto the world, and the PCs must flee in terror.

The monster could be one of many (perhaps trapped in a terra-cotta style army), or entirely unique. It could be intelligent or rampaging...or both. 


# The Branches of Darkmeyer

Another favorite of mine. This is the seventh quest in a series of human renegades overthrowing their vampire tyrants. This quest focuses on an assassination attempt by the humans against a high-ranking vampire noble, necessarily involving an infiltration of the vampire's secrete city: Darkmeyer. There, the hated noble resides, and also, a secret key to defeating the vampires...

Salient bits include:

 - A member of the Myreque is part vampire, endangering the mission.
 - A special tree is held in Darkmeyer, which can be crafted into vampire-destroying weapons
 - A special scent-based disguise is used, as vampires have weak eysight and identify by scent
 
## Adapting Darkmeyer

I like the idea of leading an insurrection against overlords. It combines many cool ideas: a team you aren't sure if you can trust, a special weapon hidden away, and a clever disguise. There is even a subplot in the quest of a vampire contact who is the noble's sister. 

This requires more setup and buy-in than others. Players may start off as regular denizens of this bleak landscape, but after some inciting incident or encounter, learn of the resistance's actions and join them. You could also have a more direct involvement of the resistance - perhaps they save a PC's life.
