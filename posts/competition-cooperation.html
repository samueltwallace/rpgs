<p><em>My focus here is on adventure games, but I think some of this
applies to other types of games. I don’t comment on them explicitly
because I don’t have much experience and don’t feel qualified to speak
on them.</em></p>
<p>I am a big fan of cooperative endeavours. I try to be cooperative in
most things I do that do not call for explicit competition. I especially
try to apply this with games and RPGs. How, why, and what are the
consequences?</p>
<h1 id="being-cooperative">Being Cooperative</h1>
<p>I see RPGs as a chance to collaborate on a shared imaginative world
with a group of people in a way reminiscent of traditional oral
storytelling. As you know, there aren’t any winners and losers in DnD,
but there are proxies that many players and referees use. Defeating the
‘BBEG,’ or clearing the dungeon, or killing all the monsters. When these
proxies are established, I think player-referee competition can take
seed.</p>
<p>Many referees opt to put challenges in the way of the goals to make
it satisfying to achieve goals. Then players see this, and depending on
their suspension of disbelief, see the referee as impeding their goal.
This only really happens when the impediments seem artificial in the
game world, and suspension of disbelief is lost, but when it happens, a
race is on. Can players outsmart the referee, and can the referee come
up with enough caveats to players’ actions to sufficiently challenge
them?</p>
<p>If this sounds appealing to you, have at it. It’s just not a play
style I want.</p>
<p>I want to be cooperative and collaborative. I don’t want players’ and
the referee’s ideas competing for who can outsmart the other, but the
ideas building off of each other into something that everyone at the
table finds cool. I, when I’m a referee, want to build up players’ ideas
into something intriguing, adventurous, or exciting.</p>
<p>This may sounds like I’m saying I do exactly the same thing but
somehow my way is better than those <em>competitive referees,</em> but
it’s not. My goal is not explicitly impede players, but instead
complicate the situation in a way players can build off with their
actions. Let’s take a look at an example.</p>
<p>In an adventure game, a thief and magic-user are on a stealth mission
under a castle. They mentioned they wanted to sneak around and do your
typical stealth mission stuff. After some overland travel, they descend
into the dungeon.</p>
<hr />
<p>The thief and magic-user navigate some tunnels, and eventually the
referee decides to lock a door in the tunnels to provide an obstacle.
The thief rolls to lockpick the door, and the party either turns back or
proceeds depending on the results.</p>
<p>The thief and magic-user navigate some tunnels, and eventually find a
ventilation tunnel that leads to the ceiling support beams of a large
underground room full of traps and treasure. The thief can then decide:
do I want to cat-burlgar my way across these support beams, potentially
saving lots of time, resources, but at the risk of a catastrophic
failure?</p>
<hr />
<p>See how much cooler the second one sounds?</p>
<p>What goes into being cooperative? Here are some rule-of-thumb
guidelines on being cooperative:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid save-or-die type results</li>
<li>Offer chances to do cool stuff as well as failing miserably,
especially offer a choice between the two.</li>
<li>Pre-plan what’s in your adventure site, don’t make everything up on
the fly. (This lets you have a stocked dungeon that doesn’t just pop up
around your players, feeling artificial).</li>
<li>Take your players’ actions, suggestions, and intentions seriously:
don’t get a superiority complex as a referee, thinking that your ideas
are better than others’.</li>
<li>Ignore fairness in games. Portray a world that everyone agrees makes
sense and sets clear expectations for what could happen.</li>
</ul>
<p>But there’s no true substitute for just working with your players and
having creative back and forth through a game medium.</p>
<h1 id="freeform-games">Freeform Games</h1>
<p>I think this cooperation vs competition dichotomy lies at the heart
of the objections to freeform (including FKR) gameplay. Many people feel
that this game is all up to ‘GM fiat,’ and because they think in the
competitive mindset of gameplay, they expect unfair challenges put up by
the referee and the dice will save them.</p>
<p>Once you realize you can step out of the competition and play in a
cooperative way, the gaming world opens up around you. No longer are you
prevented from doing the thing your goals, instead they are enhanced and
complicated (rather than the competitive ‘impossible’).</p>
<p>There’s another level to ‘GM as a player,’ beyond the fact that they
need to have fun as well. When you see the referee as simply running the
rest of the world, with the same privileges and restrictions as players
running their characters, you can have everyone on creatively equal
footing, and create a story where there are no winners and losers, but
everyone involved can contribute.</p>
