**Tunnel Goons Rules Variations**


(insert ../header.md.html here)


Here are some variations for different versions of [Tunnel Goons](https://tunnelgoons.com).

**Skill System**: Replace the three main attributes with *specific* skills, [24xx](https://jasontocci.itch.io/24xx) style. You could have sword fighting, crossbow shooting, acrobatics, sneaking, or anything else players can come up with.

**Hits**: Instead of rolling for combat, deterministic damage is exchanged. The damage is 1 plus any skill bonuses or advantages.

**Maneuvers**: If you want to do a combat maneuver, you can do so at the cost of any damage you would do. If you end up not doing damage in combat, the maneuver fails.

**Static DS**: Make every DS a 10.

**Micro-combat**: Zoom in on specific combat maneuvers to focus in on the action. Go for a stab, attempt to parry, and go frame-by-frame. Keep track of pinned limbs, positioning, etc.
