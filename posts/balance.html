<p>A game of political negotiations, deals, and subterfuge.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-this">What is this?</h1>
<p>This is an ultra-light game of politics. This is not an adventure
game, nor a resource trading game. It is an RPG that involves a lot of
talk, and not a lot of rolls.</p>
<p>Players take the roles of leaders of rival factions in a setting of
your choosing. The traditional game session is replaced with a
negotiation session between these leaders. The GM resolves actions in
between sessions, then players meet again.</p>
<p>This is a fairly free-form game that should be hacked and tweaked for
your table and situation. Feel free to slot this in as a minigame for
domain play in a traditional DnD game, perhaps invisibly to the
players.</p>
<h1 id="setup-and-setting">Setup and Setting</h1>
<p>Balance has no canonical setting. You must create one of your own. To
do so, gather all your players and do the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Give a one-sentence summary of the setting.</strong> It
could be “Feudal lords in the far future” or “Bandit gangs in ancient
Mesopotamia.” Something that gives a clear picture of what is expected
in the world.</li>
<li><strong>Create a Palette.</strong> Write a lists of includeses and
excludeses: Typical things you would know of or see in the world, and
things that don’t exist at all. For a sci-fi game, you could exclude
magic and dragons, while you would include artificial intelligence and
interstellar travel.</li>
<li><strong>Create 5 Resources for each player.</strong> A resource has
a <em>quality,</em> which cannot be negative, and starts at 3. Resources
can be anything that sits firmly within the setting. Be creative with
the typical elements of the setting and combine them in conniving ways
to make a resource. Resources may be secret, but must be cleared with
GM.</li>
<li><strong>Create 2 or more goals for each Leader.</strong> These can
be secret as well. These can be rewritten and added to as you like.</li>
<li><strong>Create History between Leaders.</strong> Every leader has at
least two past conflict with other leaders. Create them and detail them
as you like.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="playing-the-game">Playing the Game</h1>
<p>From here on out, the game is entirely conversation and a few
rolls.</p>
<p>When resources are traded, exchanged, or put against another’s
resources, the GM makes <em>quality rolls.</em> The GM rolls as many
d6’s as the quality of the involved resources. The result depends on the
type of interaction: symbiotic, neutral, or combative.</p>
<p>A symbiotic interaction is when both parties would benefit from the
interaction. On a symbiotic roll, for each 4-6 rolled on each side on
the quality roll, the resource owner adds 1 to the resource quality.
Trade deals and treaties fall into this category.</p>
<p>A combative interaction is when there is competition between two
leaders. The GM rolls both quality rolls, then count the number of
4-6’s. Whoever has fewer decreases their quality by the difference
between the amount. War, assassinations, and rival political campaigns
fall into this category.</p>
<p>Trading resources is freely allowed with no rules.</p>
<p>If a resource is reduced to 0 quality or below, it is gone.</p>
<p>Game world interaction also falls into these roll categories.
Harvesting natural resources, for example, is a symbiotic interaction
with the game world. Fighting NPC leaders is a combative roll.</p>
<p>If players choose to use a secret resource in an interaction, it must
be revealed to the other party. They may remain secret otherwise.</p>
<p>All resource management and quality rolls must be cleared with the GM
and the other party will be notified. To use a resource in a quality
roll, it must make in-universe sense for the fiction of the interaction.
The GM makes the final call on whether a resource is viable in a
roll.</p>
<p>There are no other rules or restrictions on your gameplay, as your GM
allows.</p>
<h1 id="play-advice-design-notes">Play Advice &amp; Design Notes</h1>
<p>There is no guidelines for communication in this game. You may run
this as you like. An open, public table can be useful for some
occasions, but allowing leaders the ability to secretly communicate with
other leaders allows for a lot of scheming.</p>
<p>Resources can be literally anything. The most useful resources are
the most versatile, like a science research team or a transportation
fleet.</p>
<p>Focus on the story and fiction. Every roll must be accompanied by an
in-universe discussion, and it should go far beyond the roll itself.</p>
<p>This game has no mechanical slant of collaborative or competitive.
You could play it either way.</p>
<p>Having no resources doesn’t mean you’re out of the game. It just
means you have no power. A generous benefactor could loan you
resources.</p>
<p>The GM should run one or more NPC factions, and manage world
resources. Consider adding a hidden quality to GM resources to make them
non-renewable.</p>
<p>There is no system for alliances. These should develop organically
during play.</p>
<p>This game could be played GMless. In this case, do more setting work
so that everyone has a feel for the setting.</p>
<p>The GM can do a lot to make the world feel dynamic. Send out a
current events notice every so often of public information, or new
developments.</p>
<p>You should run this game with a consistent time scaling. For example,
every real-time week is a year in-game. With this, you can populate
natural resources in a real-time compatible sense.</p>
