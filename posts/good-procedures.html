<h1 class="title">What Makes a Good Procedure?</h1>
<p class="author">Sam W</p>
<center><a href="/">Home</a> | <a href="/subscriptions.opml">Blogroll (opml)</a></center>
</header>
<p>I want to propose a set of criteria for good procedures and take a
look at some procedures. We will look at some good ones, some ones not
in my favor, and take some conclusions to logical extremes to see why
they fail. This is mostly going to apply to OSR-style procedures, in
particular, we are going to look mainly at random generation
procedures.</p>
<h1 id="the-criteria">The Criteria</h1>
<p>The criteria I want to propose for what makes a procedurable
desireable are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The procedure should have a small mental overhead to perform,</li>
<li>The procedure should reinforce challenges the game sets out to
perform,</li>
<li>The procedure should be developable as part of the game world.</li>
</ol>
<p>To clarify, ‘mental overhead’ is the amount of thinking required to
complete the procedure: remembering what to roll, sorting through the
relevant table, and interpreting the result (if necessary).</p>
<p>Notice that point 2, for our OSR case, has a substitution that can be
made: the challenges of the game. OSR challenges are often diegetic
puzzles and resource management.</p>
<p>And finally, the results of the procedure should have clear
in-fiction interpretations that make sense for the game at its current
state. Moreover, you should be able to develop the results of the
procedure into further fiction.</p>
<p>These criteria, when all met, create engaging and streamlined
procedures that encourage the desired play. It’s a win–win for player
and referee, as no one has to do the mental heavy lifting and something
interesting happens in the game.</p>
<p>Let’s judge some procedures on these criteria.</p>
<h1 id="combat-procedures-initiative">Combat Procedures: Initiative</h1>
<p>We are going to look at the default initiative systems of 5e,
<em>Knave</em>, and OD&amp;D and critique or praise their adherence to
the principles.</p>
<h2 id="e">5e</h2>
<p>If you’re not familiar, 5e runs initiative as follows: everyone rolls
an ‘initiative check,’ then initiative proceeds by highest scores of
individuals.</p>
<p>Mental Overhead: <strong>Poor.</strong> This is a particular
intensive way to track initiative. It needs a special check (why would a
simple Dex check not be sufficient?), and keeping track of a random
order of players. At a big table, this is a disaster to track. Moreover,
there is mental overhead in planning your turn and not being bored
between your turns.</p>
<p>Challenges: <strong>Good.</strong> What are the challenges of 5e? To
me, 5e challenges players to use their special abilities to act as
heroes. 5e has a “spotlight” initiative system: everyone gets their
moment to shine. This is perfect for heroic moments and big moves.</p>
<p>(You may disagree on the challenge 5e sets out to pose, in which
case, you can modify this argument as you see fit).</p>
<p>Developable: <strong>Poor.</strong> I find 5e initiative to be
immersion breaking. It precludes direct collaboration, and simplifies
many time–tracking aspects of combat - i.e. why does every action take
the same time to perform? Moreover, there is no extension to the
procedure to allow nonstandard actions: teaming up, as mentioned, or
taking multi–turn actions. There is nothing you can do to extend the
procedure in a fictional way.</p>
<h2 id="knave">Knave</h2>
<p><em>Knave</em> gives a 50-50 chance of all players going first each
round, rerolled every round.</p>
<p>Mental Overhead: <strong>Fair.</strong> It’s easy to do but easy to
forget. I would be too accustomed to alternating turns to remember to
reroll every round. The side-based initiative is great on every other
account. Easy to manage who is going when, and easy to come up with
actions to perform when you can collaborate. Also goes much quicker.</p>
<p>Challenges: <strong>Excellent.</strong> Luckily with <em>Knave</em>,
we have designer’s notes. <em>Knave</em> sets out for combat to be easy
to track and keep ‘players engaged.’ It also looks to make combat more
dangerous. I think the last two points are well upheld (as is the first
one, as previously discussed). It is engaging, as you need to be on your
toes and be reactive to win (since the order is so unpredictable), and
combat is dangerous, as you can get smacked twice in a row.</p>
<p>Developable: <strong>Fair.</strong> <em>Knave</em> seems to have one
kind of fight in mind with this initiative procedure: a head–on melee.
There are no accomodations in the rules made for suprise attacks of
various kinds, like an ambush; nor is there accomodations for special
attacks like a crossbow sniper’s headshot. These things can be figured
out at the table with a house rule, but the basic mechanic seems to be
restrictive for those cases.</p>
<h2 id="odd">OD&amp;D</h2>
<p>I am going to specifically look at the <em>White Box: Fantastic
Medieval Adventure Game</em> Alternate combat system, with the 4M phases
(for contrast with <em>Knave</em>, which is otherwise very similar). You
roll side based initiative (50-50, rerolled every round). The referee
may also determine surprise at the beginning, suggsted either with a
judgement or a roll. Then prepared spells are cast (Magic), followed by
Missile attacks, Melee combat, and then Movement, all in initiative
order within each phase.</p>
<p>Mental Overhead: <strong>Poor.</strong> You need to alternate sides
in the correct order in each M-phase, and keep track of the four phases.
For a table of less than 4 players, you’re keeping track of more phases
than players! This can be a logistical headache.</p>
<p>Challenges: <strong>Excellent.</strong> OD&amp;D looks to be a
tactics–based victory in a chaotic battle. The phases keep good track of
time to allow some planning, but the side–based initiative keeps
everyone on their toes.</p>
<p>Developable: <strong>Fair.</strong> This suffers from the same
drawback as <em>Knave</em>: it has minimal ability to accomodate
non-melee situations.</p>
<h2 id="bonus-into-the-odd">Bonus: Into the Odd</h2>
<p><em>Into the Odd</em> runs side-based initiative, with a first round
for players if they succeed on a Dex save.</p>
<p>Mental Overhead: <strong>Excellent.</strong> Uses an existing roll
for determining surprise, and proceeds side–based.</p>
<p>Challenges: <strong>Good.</strong> <em>Into the Odd</em>’s likes to
encourage lateral thinking an unfair fights. The extra first round
reinforces that well.</p>
<p>Developable: <strong>Good.</strong> That free round could be
extended, or eliminated entirely in the right scenario. Headshot? Boom.
Easy to figure out how to do.</p>
<h1 id="addendum-intended-goals-vs-achieved-goals">Addendum: Intended
Goals vs Achieved Goals</h1>
<p>There’s a saying that goes back in game design: the behavior that you
reward is the behavior you encourage. When creating a procedure, keep
this in mind. The challenges posed should give rewards when overcome;
whether the reward is a level, gold, or an item. How can players act in
your procedure? What routes do they have to success? Do they reward the
challenge you intend?</p>
<p>The Way of Game Design is one of freeing players without leading
them. They must find a path in the provided structure without it being
obvious or designed for them.</p>
