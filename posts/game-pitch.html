<p>Here’s the world and system for the only game I want to run.</p>
<p>This is pretty short; it’s a meta-level primer for players to engage
with a goal. More is revealed as more is explored.</p>
<h1 id="setting">Setting</h1>
<p>The continent of Netzinea is hardly civilized. It has one metropolis
at its center, and its civilization fades the farther away you go. The
regions of the continent are named after part of the eyeball, as their
is an intense focus towards the center.</p>
<h2 id="the-sclera">The Sclera</h2>
<p>A collection of uncivilized wildlands. Various beasts, monstrosities,
and demons roam the dark forests, blasted wastelands, and inpenetrable
deserts of this area. That’s not to say it’s uninhabited by any sorts of
humans, but their ununified societies and lifestyles are radically
different from the more unified societies. Relationships among these
small societies are tense at best, as there is often fierce competition
for resources.</p>
<p>The geography of the Sclera is varied, but generally low elevation.
Swamps or steep cliffs border the ocean.</p>
<h2 id="the-iris">The Iris</h2>
<p>This is an extensive borderland between the Pupil and the Sclera. It
is inhabited by a mixture of more outdoors-inclined city inhabitants,
and more orderly wild people. This is a regions with a shifting exterior
border, as new settlements are set up and destroyed, but a fixed
internal border with the pupil, in the form of a huge wall of mountains
with guarded passes.</p>
<p>The geography is similarly varied as the Sclera, but there is a net
elevation drop outwards from the center.</p>
<h2 id="the-pupil">The Pupil</h2>
<p>Inside a solid ring of mountains is the largest unified society on
Netzinea: The Hidden City of Goeina. It is mostly below ground for
safety, though one tall watchtower is visible from miles away. City
issued passes are required for most activities and entrance to
Goeina.</p>
<p>The city is very large; people spend years mapping even sections of
it. The Fort Mountains are the highest elevation on the continent.</p>
<h2 id="who-lives-here">Who Lives Here?</h2>
<p>Goeina is almost entirely human, except for a few more abnormal
creatures that have been permitted to pass. There are no elves, dwarves,
or orcs; they are said to have all died in a war long ago. Remains of
their civilizations can be found in many places.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Long ago there was a big war where all the elves, dwarves, and orcs
died. Ruins of their civilizations can be found all around. Humans, the
omnipresent cockroach, survived and took up whatever scraps remained to
form Goeina.</p>
<h1 id="rules">Rules</h1>
<p>Basically Tunnel Goons, with a few rules on how to handle a few extra
situations, and a couple modifications:</p>
<p>Replace the class scores with specific skills: Brute -&gt; lifting
heavy stuff OR hand to hand combat; Skulker -&gt; sneaking OR shooting a
crossbow OR acrobatics; etc. Let players come up with their own!</p>
<p>Have an extensive equipment list: Start with 3 inventory slots of
items off of lists. Have a wide availability of fantasy gear.</p>
<p>Spells: they ‘just happen.’ If under pressure to perform the spell
ritual, you may need to roll.</p>
<p>Need to Save vs Damage? If you roll below the DS, take damage equal
to the difference between the DS and your roll. Otherwise take no damage
and succeed.</p>
<h2 id="characterparty-creation">Character/Party Creation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Choose 3 specific skills you are good at. You get +1 to rolls that
use this skill. Make these up yourself, or consult 24xx, Old School
Stylish.</li>
<li>Choose 3 pieces of equipment off the list or make it up.</li>
<li>State a personal goal of your character that ties into the world
(make up details of the world as necessary).</li>
<li>Create a group goal for what the party wants to accomplish short
term.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="magic">Magic</h2>
<p>All magic is crafting. It’s manipulating new physics that are not
entirely understood. You need to combine an energy source with mechanics
to produce the desired effect. The construction and results are up to
you.</p>
<p>There is some naturally occurring magical effects in the world
(nature is governed of physics). You may come across strange effects in
the wild and reverse-engineer their inner workings to be able to produce
new magical devices.</p>
<p>You do this as a player by stealing keywords from the world,
Whitehack-style. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fire-breathing dragon + fungal spores = ember spray shroom</li>
<li>igneous rock + spirit ward = soul fossilizer</li>
<li>fresh hail + enchanted arrow = hail of arrows</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="making-history">Making History</h1>
<p>Players may keep a record of their events that will be found and
recorded. All future players may go back and read these notes for
in-world info.</p>
