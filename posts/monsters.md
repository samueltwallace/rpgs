Stat-less monsters.

 - These humanoids visit towns at night. They knock on doors, asking to be let in in a myriad of voices, tones, and pleas. They dress in rags, have a mouth of sharp teeth, and instead of any other facial features, wrinkles and loose skin. If you answer the door, you join them. They are super strong and super fast. The only way to survive is to hide inside.
