**Reading OD&D in 2023**

(insert ../header.md.html here)

So I got the original booklets for OD&D, and some supplements, including Philotomy's excellent suggestions.
I have been reading them... and wanted to analyze them in the context of the much more modern games I have read.


# RAW

The rules are generally only suggestive. 
The book touts itself as "guidelines to follow for designing your own fantastic-medieval campaign."
As such, it only really outlines what the numbers are indicative of, leaving it mostly for the Referee to leave open (I would say for flexibility). 
For example, "the charisma score is usable to decide such things as whether or not a witch capturing a player will turn him into a swine or keep him enchanted as a lover." 

It also includes various open-ended things that can be implemented, should they be needed: Relatives, being a prime example. 
Relatives may inherit money from dead or missing PCs, but should that PC return, they can reclaim it. 
How this happens, in the fiction, is left totally up to Ref discretion.
Is this the law? 
Is it what actually happens?
Let's play and find out!

This naturally leads into OSR and FKR playstyles.
In fact, it reinforces why I like these playstyles.
OD&D doesn't rely on these interconnected numbers that are based around a core mechanic, instead it gives ideas for simply... playing.
Not balancing or plotcrafting, but interacting to see what happens.


# Philotomy

I think Philotomy's clarifications are indispensable.
I think what made me love them is the description of abstract combat.
The idea that an attack and damage roll over a round of combat is a description of how much damage you got in during your combat round time is extremely perceptive of the rules.
