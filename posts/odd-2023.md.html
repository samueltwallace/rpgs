**Reading OD&D in 2023**

(insert ../header.md.html here)

So I got the original booklets for OD&D, and some supplements, including Philotomy's excellent suggestions.
I have been reading them... and wanted to analyze them in the context of the much more modern games I have read.


# RAW

It's struck me how relaxed the original game takes itself. It portrays itself as "guidelines to follow in designing your own fantastic-medieval campaign. They provide the framework around which you will build a game of simplicity or tremendous complexity — your time and imagination are about the only limiting factors, and the fact that you have purchased these rules tends to indicate that there is no lack of imagination — the fascination of the game will tend to make participants find more and more time." It's not serious about how it should be played, and doesn't enforce hard and fast rules -- instead it reminds you that what happens at the table is of prime importance. 

Many of the rules follow in this fashion. There are rules for all sorts of random things: relatives and inheritance, jousting, naval combat; all of which have no explicit design purpose and do not really come together for a coherent game, but are evidence of play, rules made up on the fly, and fun. Of course, I'm not Gygax or Arneson and may not have the same values or type of fun as them, but it is still a way to design a game that communicates, most of all, the desire to play and have fun. 

This can cause some confusion, though. Readers might see all the rules with dice rolls and think the game centers around actions requiring rolls. However, you should remember the introduction and see that you should play this in a way that is fun. This may mean diverging from the perceived intent or a close reading of the rules -- but don't forget, these are guidelines.

Another interesting part of this passage I've been harping on is that there isn't a distinction drawn between the rules and the play. Both are "the game," which I take as synonymous with a "campaign." I appreciate the idea that your rules and your play are inextricably bound. My justification of this point (though not said in the booklets), is that your mechanics should be thought about how they reflect the fiction of a situation. 


# Philotomy

I think Philotomy's clarifications are indispensable.
I think what made me love them is the description of abstract combat.
The idea that an attack and damage roll over a round of combat is a description of how much damage you got in during your combat round time is extremely perceptive of the rules.
