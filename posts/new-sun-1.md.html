**Book of the New Sun, Part 1**

(insert ../header.md.html here)

I have been reading *The Book of the New Sun* recently. 
I have read only the first in the series, but about 1.5 times by now.
I really like it. 

It is an interesting mix of science fiction and fantasy. 
Though nominally set far in the future, it reads like low fantasy with strange trippy elements.
A near--total loss of technological knowledge has put society into a near dark ages, and various medieval--style guilds maintain the remainders of eons past.
Our modern words are lost in history to them -- one character cannot remember the word electricity -- making the world feel immensely old, with layers of cultural cruft and crust layered in every place with even an ounce of history. 

The narrator and protagonist is also a truly interesting character, for he is apparently of unfailing memory but also is deeply wound up in how he wants to tell the story, creating moments of detail where you would not expect, and skips over parts you would expect another author to flesh out. 

Severian is also a very sensitive and internally emotive person.
His recollection is interwoven with his deep epiphanies, impressions, and feelings that so perfectly characterize the internal lives of young men.
