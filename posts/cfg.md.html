(insert ../header.md.html here)

So you want a simple version of dungeoncrawling. Here is a freeform interpretation.

# Generate Character

Choose a type: Brutish or Erudite. 

## Brutish

Roll d6 for each column:

| I was a     | who was known for  | but suffers from   | my most valuable possession is |
|:-----------:|:------------------:|--------------------|:------------------------------:|
| city guard  | dexterity          | blackmail threat   | a sharp sword                  |
| executioner | keen senses        | rage               | a huge axe                     |
| hunter      | stealth            | cowardice          | a sturdy longbow               |
| knight      | survival skills    | addiction          | a shining sword                |
| sailor      | physical endurance | mythomania         | a heavy crossbow               |
| soldier     | strength           | compulsive spender | a bloody mace                  |

You may be armored.

## Erudite

Roll d6 for each column:

| I was a    | who was known for   | but suffers from  | my most valuable possession is |
|:----------:|:-------------------:|:-----------------:|:------------------------------:|
| accountant | magical knowledge   | paranoia          | a translation guide            |
| lord       | knowledge of nature | recurrent illness | a stack of cash                |
| merchant   | religious knowledge | anxiety           | a rare drug                    |
| monk       | architectural eye   | cowardice         | a book of local history        |
| navigator  | steady hand         | exile             | an expert map of the area      |
| scholar    | detailed memory     | greed             | a bestiary                     |

You may have a spell. You can cast it once a day without consequence. Beyond that, see if your control of the power is strong enough to prevent a mishap.

# Rules

Figure out what makes sense before resorting to anything here.

- Skorne combat: You can take 4 hits, or 5 if armored. 1-2 hit per attack. Recovers 1/day.
- Cairn inventory: 8-10 items, big items take 2+ slots, small items bundle, and fatigue may take a slot. Drop a fatigue with 24 hours' rest.
- Traveller Resolution: 9+ on a 2d6, or 7+ if task fits your skills.
- Magic from any supplement or source you like.

Structure the crawl to make resources valuable. 10 minute turns, reaction rolls, morale checks. Outdoor survival if necessary.

Give hard choices and dilemmas, provide maximal information. Play dungeon denizens as smart as players do.
