<h1 class="title">Reading OD&amp;D in 2023</h1>

<p>So I got the original booklets for OD&amp;D, and some supplements,
including Philotomy’s excellent suggestions. I have been reading them…
and wanted to analyze them in the context of the much more modern games
I have read.</p>
<h1 id="raw">RAW</h1>
<p>It’s struck me how relaxed the original game takes itself. It
portrays itself as “guidelines to follow in designing your own
fantastic-medieval campaign. They provide the framework around which you
will build a game of simplicity or tremendous complexity — your time and
imagination are about the only limiting factors, and the fact that you
have purchased these rules tends to indicate that there is no lack of
imagination — the fascination of the game will tend to make participants
find more and more time.” It’s not serious about how it should be
played, and doesn’t enforce hard and fast rules – instead it reminds you
that what happens at the table is of prime importance.</p>
<p>Many of the rules follow in this fashion. There are rules for all
sorts of random things: relatives and inheritance, jousting, naval
combat; all of which have no explicit design purpose and do not really
come together for a coherent game, but are evidence of play, rules made
up on the fly, and fun. Of course, I’m not Gygax or Arneson and may not
have the same values or type of fun as them, but it is still a way to
design a game that communicates, most of all, the desire to play and
have fun.</p>
<p>This can cause some confusion, though. Readers might see all the
rules with dice rolls and think the game centers around actions
requiring rolls. However, you should remember the introduction and see
that you should play this in a way that is fun. This may mean diverging
from the perceived intent or a close reading of the rules – but don’t
forget, these are guidelines.</p>
<p>Another interesting part of this passage I’ve been harping on is that
there isn’t a distinction drawn between the rules and the play. Both are
“the game,” which I take as synonymous with a “campaign.” I appreciate
the idea that your rules and your play are inextricably bound. My
justification of this point (though not said in the booklets), is that
your mechanics should be thought about how they reflect the fiction of a
situation.</p>
<p>Overall, I really like the sense of imaginative freedom these
booklets encourages you to have. It’s one of the few systems that makes
me feel like I can do anything in a game.</p>
<h1 id="philotomy">Philotomy</h1>
<p>I really appreciate Philtomy’s Musings because they show me how to
interpret the rules as a representation of the in-game actions. They
show me that the rules need to retain abstractness to have in-game
meaning. The two examples I’ll explain are combat and gold for XP.</p>
<p>Philotomy explains combat as an abstraction. The attack roll, for
instance, is the culmination of all the missile or melee attacks made
during a round, not individual shots or swings. He then derives from
this interpretation that called shots are not included, because an
attack roll doesn’t represent an individual attack and thus a successful
attack only loosely correlates to a successful strike.</p>
<p>Gold for XP is explained not as “I spend money and this directly
increases my abilities as an adventurer,” but instead as a marker of
good adventuring done well. Every adventure ends up paying something, so
if you don’t have gold, you haven’t been adventuring! It’s a progress
meter, not a direct mechanical effect. It is analogized to HP, which do
not reflect some literal in-world condition, but instead are just
indicative of your ability to keep standing and fighting.</p>
<p>These two explanations of abstract mechanics reveal to me that there
is 1) a clear, though abstract, relationship between the in-game actions
and the mechanics implemented, and 2) very simple and straightforward
ways to implement complex in-game content as simple mechanics. This has
opened my eyes to “the OD&amp;D way:” in a complex in-game situation
with high variability, you may introduce abstraction to resolve actions.
It may be criticized as unrealistic, but you can make sense of it
through the lens of abstraction.</p>
