{\Large \textbf{Goonsspiel}}

\begin{multicols}{2}
  This is a slightly more FKR--bent \href{https://tunnelgoons.com}{Tunnel Goons}. \\

  {\large \textbf{Playing the Game}} \\
  One player acts as referee, describing the world, its inhabitants and dangers, and all other players control characters in this world. \\

  {\large \textbf{Character Creation}} \\

  Decide on 3 specific skills that your character is adept at.
  Have players come up with these skills themselves.
  Come up with a personal goal for your character, and a connection to an NPC.
  Come up with 3 rather mundane equipment that your character starts with.
  You have a base inventory size of 4, which may be increased by other equipment (such as a backpack). \\

  {\large \textbf{Risky Encounters and Violence}} \\

  If there is reasonable doubt that an action might succeed, roll 2d6.
  Add one to the roll for each item, skill, or factor that contributes to the success.
  Total up the number of factors countering success and add that number to 10 to create the target.
  If your modified roll is greater than or equal to the target, you succeed.
  Otherwise, you are unsuccessful. \\

  Every character can take 4 hits; add to this number for armor pieces equipped or relevant defensive skills.
  Usual attacks can deal 1-4 hits; agree on a number that makes sense based on character skills and equipment.
  Players may attempt non--damage maneuvers by sacrificing any hits that would be dealt. \\
