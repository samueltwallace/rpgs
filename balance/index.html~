**Balance**



A game of political negotiations, deals, and subterfuge.


# What is this?

This is an ultra-light game of politics. This is not an adventure game, nor a resource trading game. It is an RPG that involves a lot of talk, and not a lot of rolls.

Players take the roles of leaders of rival factions in a setting of your choosing. The traditional game session is replaced with a negotiation session between these leaders. The GM resolves actions in between sessions, then players meet again. 

This is a fairly free-form game that should be hacked and tweaked for your table and situation. Feel free to slot this in as a minigame for domain play in a traditional DnD game, perhaps invisibly to the players.


# Setup and Setting

Balance has no canonical setting. You must create one of your own. To do so, gather all your players and do the following:

1. **Give a one-sentence summary of the setting.** It could be "Feudal lords in the far future" or "Bandit gangs in ancient Mesopotamia." Something that gives a clear picture of what is expected in the world.
2. **Create a Palette.** Write a lists of includeses and excludeses: Typical things you would know of or see in the world, and things that don't exist at all. For a sci-fi game, you could exclude magic and dragons, while you would include artificial intelligence and interstellar travel.
3. **Create 5 Resources for each player.** A resource has a *quality,* which cannot be negative, and starts at 3. Resources can be anything that sits firmly within the setting. Be creative with the typical elements of the setting and combine them in conniving ways to make a resource. Resources may be secret, but must be cleared with GM.
4. **Create 2 goals for each Leader.** These can be secret as well. These can be rewritten and added to as you like. 



# Playing the Game

From here on out, the game is entirely conversation and a few rolls. 

When resources are traded, exchanged, or put against another's resources, make a *quality roll.* Both leaders roll as many d6's as the quality of the involved resources. The result depends on the type of interaction: symbiotic, neutral, or combative. 

A symbiotic interaction is when both parties would benefit from the interaction. On a symbiotic roll, for each 4-6 a player rolls on the quality roll, they add 1 to the resource quality.

A netural interaction is when there is an even exchange of resources, such as in a trade deal. In this case, you may exchange the resources with quality that is subtracted from the quality of your resource. For example, if John has a quality 4 military and Ahmad has a quality 3 mercantile goods, they may exchange up to 4 quality of army for up to 3 quality of goods, which are then subtracted from the original owner's quality. (I lied, no rolling here).

A combative interaction is when there is competition between two leaders. Both players roll a quality roll, then count the number of 4-6's. Whoever has fewer decreases their quality by the difference between the amount.

Game world interaction also falls into these categories. Harvesting natural resources, for example, is a neutral interaction with the game world. Fighting NPC leaders is a combative roll.
