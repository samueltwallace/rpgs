# Introduction

> The ruined factory stood three stories high in an otherwise featureless landscape. Although somewhat imposing on its own terms, it occupied only the most unobstrusive place within the the gray emptiness of its surroundings, its presence serving as a mere accent upon a desolate horizon. [...] the whole of the Red Tower, as the factory was known, had always been subject to fadings at certain times. This phenomenon, in the delirious or dying words of several witnesses, was due to a profound hostility between the noisy and malodorous operations of the facility and the desolate purity of the landscape surrounding it, the conflict occasionally resulting in temporary erasures, or fadings, of the former by the latter.

> Thomas Ligotti, "The Red Tower"

------

> Here there are houses which dribble pale mucus, an organic daubing that smears base façades and oozes from top windows. Extra storeys are rendered in the cold white muck which fills gaps between houses and dead-end alleys. The landscape is defaced with ripples as if wax has melted and set suddenly across the rooftops. Some other intelligence has mad these human streets their own.

> China Miéville, *Perdido Street Station*

This is background list and setting toolbox for a dark fantasy setting. Inspired by the desolate spectrum from RuneScape's Morytania to the paintings of Zdzisław Beksiński, these random tables should help you build a setting of any level of structure or detail.
