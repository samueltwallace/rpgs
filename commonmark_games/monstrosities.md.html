# Monstrosities

Here are some monstrosities out of my brain.

## Animal-Based

### Sleep Moths

These moths feed on humanoids' saliva and injects them with a psychoactive compound that causes somnambulism for several weeks.
The sleep is especially deep, and somnambulists can become violent if attempted to be woken.

The moths cannot handle prolonged sunlight exposure and live in dark places.
They stay near their sources of nutrition, venturing forth at night to feed.
Their wingspan is 12 feet and they can stand as tall as a large dog on the ground.

Optional Stats: 4 HD, AC 14, Move 60', Attacks: Mandibles, Suck Saliva.


### Brain Pollinators

Tiny butterflies that can carry information from brain to brian.
They float in through exposed cranial orifices to the brain, pollinate, then leave.
Pollinators are too small to really make out what their form is, almost indistinguishable from oversized quickly-moving dust particles.

The overall effect on the pollinated is to transmit ideas, at the highest complexity the receiver can understand.
If a large enough swarm of pollinators is present near enough exposed brains, they will become overwhelmed with a common thought.
The resulting actions depend entirely on the transmitted thought.
If a huge swarm is present, the affected group can achieve a hive-mind status.


No stats; too small to fight!


### Furnace Grizzly

Not entirely organic, a furnace grizzly is a organism-made-machine that is in the form of a large bear but with a roaring furnace of a heart.
It is a deforestation device; it devastates woodlands one tree at a time, reducing them to ash.
To destroy, it must be dismantled or its fire quenched.


Optional Stats: 8 HD, AC 17, Move 40', Attacks: Claw, Spurt Flame.

### Narlotl

A mad wizard's cross beween a narwhal and an axolotl. 
About the size of a house cat, they are pale white, have external gills like an axolotl, and a horn like a narwhal.
They can only live in slightly warm water and need excellent oxygenation and nutritional balance to survive.

Narlotls are extremely rare and a trophy animal.
They are trapped by hunters and sold for a high price. 
They are also revered by several cultures for their resemblance to angels, unicorns, and mermaids.
Their organs are used in many traditional medicines, purporting various ameliorative effects.

Optional Stats: 1 HD, AC 10, Move 5', Attacks: Toothless bite.


### Wolverine Spider

A terrible beast to behold: a shaggy fur coat and eight limbs ending wolverine claws.
Living solitarily in nests deep in cold environments, these beasts are very territorial and have a keen sense of smell.
They are apex preadators, hunting down anything big enough to not be utterly destroyed by their attacks.

Optional Stats: 8 HD, AC 18, Move 60', Attacks: Bite, Claws.

### ??? Shark

### ??? Gorilla

## Fiction-Based

### Prowler Dragon

A dragon that cannot stop flying else it dies.
It has a metabolism and biology that demands near-constant feeding.
It is a terrible menace to surrounding ecology and settlements.

They are said to come from biology principles run overexcited: some small fish grow to the size of their containers.
The same can be true of any creature; that given enough food and space, it can grow without bound.
Prowler dragons are said to be the result of this principle applied to hummingbirds.
As a result, every prowler is unique and depending on its habitat, of different size and form.

Varying stats.
