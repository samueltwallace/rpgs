# Monstrosities

Here are some monstrosities out of my brain.

## Animal-Based

### Sleep Moths

These moths feed on humanoids' saliva and injects them with a psychoactive compound that causes somnambulism for several weeks.
The sleep is especially deep, and somnambulists can become violent if attempted to be woken.

The moths cannot handle prolonged sunlight exposure and live in dark places.
They stay near their sources of nutrition, venturing forth at night to feed.
Their wingspan is 12 feet and they can stand as tall as a large dog on the ground.

### Brain Pollinators

Tiny butterflies that can carry information from brain to brian.
They float in through exposed cranial orifices to the brain, pollinate, then leave.
Pollinators are too small to really make out what their form is, almost indistinguishable from oversized quickly-moving dust particles.

The overall effect on the pollinated is to transmit ideas, at the highest complexity the receiver can understand.
If a large enough swarm of pollinators is present near enough exposed brains, they will become overwhelmed with a common thought.
The resulting actions depend entirely on the transmitted thought.
If a huge swarm is present, the affected group can achieve a hive-mind status.


No stats; too small to fight!


### Furnace Grizzly

Not entirely organic, a furnace grizzly is a organism-made-machine that is in the form of a large bear but with a roaring furnace of a heart.
It is a deforestation device; it devastates woodlands one tree at a time, reducing them to ash.
To destroy, it must be dismantled or its fire quenched.
