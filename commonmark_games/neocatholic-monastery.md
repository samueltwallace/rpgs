# Introduction

![](./logic-gates.png){width=100%}

This is a system-neutral location-based adventure centered around a dilapidated automaton monastery. After its many years of autonomous operation, it is finally failing, beyond apparent repair.

  * [ ] possibility for repair
  * [ ] list of rooms from html
  * [ ] patrolling monks "like clockwork"
  * [ ] logic gate doors
  * [ ] antivirus abbot
  * [ ] PCB layout of rooms
  * [ ] scrounge around for parts table

## What is in the Monastery

Most of the monastery is damaged and many of its power components have failed in the many years it was active. Composed of now mostly obsolete technology, the walls are still standing despite the widespread failure. Still, some aspects of the monastery still operate: A small portion of the monks still patrol the halls, defending the place from external threats (they term 'viruses'). The abbot directs these groups.

Several of the abnormal doors still operate. 3 of the 4 logic gates still function. These are noted in the area descriptions.

There are many broken electrical and mechanical parts scattered about. If players search a room, roll on the following table. All the items obviously requiring power have inputs for battery pack cables. They are also labeled.

|       |                                                                                                                                                 |

| 1     | **Remote Eyeball**: Camera live display onto a small tablet. Runs for 30 minutes.                                                               |
| 2     | **Mega Transistor**: Heats up a fist-sized block of alloy enough to melt metal.                                                                 |
| 3     | **Mini magnet**: A handheld lump of iron with a strong enough magnetic pull to drag 10 pounds across the floor.                                 |
| 4     | **Discarded arm**: A monk's arm; will flail around for several minutes, likely making noise.                                                    |
| 5     | **Printed Prayer Board**: Plate with printed binary prayers. Reading causes monks to go into reverent silence.                                  |
| 6     | **Silencer**: Active noise-isolation device. Makes makes a sound barrier surrounding the room.                                                  |
| 7     | **Static-y Speaker**: Produces ten minutes of loud static.                                                                                      |
| 8     | **Holograph Generator**: Produces a looping moving image of a walking monk. Projectable up to 20 feet.                                          |
| 9     | **Motion Sensor**: Sounds an alarm if motion is detected.                                                                                       |
| 10-12 | **Battery pack** (backpack sized): Can provide 3 short bursts of power. Each burst turns off a green light on the battery, until none are left. |

## Nature of the Monks

The monks of the monastery are kept as setting-neutral as possible by having their technological nature left unspecified. However, fit your setting, you may need to modify aspects of the monks. They are intended as being powered electrically, with obviously mechanical bodies. 

This adventure is easily modified if you choose the monks to be android-like, in being visually indistinguishable from a human. It is also feasible to change the adventure so that the monks are magically powered, rather than purely scientific forms of power. Since their form is not explicitly decided, they are not referred in the main text as robots, automatons, or androids, simply monks.

## Encounters

**8 monks** travel like clockwork in a group between rooms, praying **in each room for 30 minutes** before moving on. They take **10 minutes to move**. They traverse the rooms in the following order: **1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 10, 13, 12, 11, 8, 7, 6, 4** then repeating. So when the players enter the dungeon, the monks begin in room 1. However you keep track or mark dungeon turns, make additional notes for the monks' movement.

The monks are intent on reaching their destination to pray. They will not take kindly to intruders, asking them at first not to disturb their prayer, then escalating if the intruders do not leave. 

## Rooms

Walls are ultra-hardened plastic material. Can take a beating. All rooms have doors, made of the same material.

### 1 Narthex

An entrance hall to the main rooms of the monastery. Several statuettes and sculptures of gears, circuit parts, and electronics schematics, all labeled with names of the monks they came from.

An inscription above the main entrance reads "Investigating the joy of consciousness the precision of mechanism."

Doors to hallways out all walls.


### Cathedral

A grand open space, dominated by pews and a large altar.


### Cloister & Garth

A small garden, surrounded by a covered walkway.


### Sacristy

### Bakehouse

### Bell Tower

Where the daily schedule is kept.


### Fishpond

A small artificial pond with some live fish, in an open courtyard.



### Storage Cellar

Some stored stuff. Roll 1d6:

1. Extra processor chips
2. Wine casks
3. Extra batteries for monks
4. Solder material
5. Extra android parts


### Infirmary

Where damage is repaired.


### Solder Workshop

Electrical parts are made and repaired here.


### Prison
