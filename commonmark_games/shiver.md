# Base Camp

You are a group of cold-weather explorers. One player is distinct, controlling not a single character, but instead adjudicating the response of the cold world to the explorers. The task of the explorers is to survive as they venture. To do so will require much advance planning, the proper equipment, and diligence.

To play, use these rules, two six-sided dice, and any scratch paper necessary for planning.

# Camp 1: Traits

You are generally described by 3 traits in the cold: Strength, Mobility, and Endurance. You keep track of a bonus for each, ranging -2 to 2.

Strength measures how much power you can exert through your body. You can carry items of your strength bonus + 6. Any more, and you take -1 from all rolls per item in excess.

Mobility shows your range of motion and agility.

Endurance is how much exposure to the cold you can take.

# Camp 2: Rolls

Most immediate dangers can be avoided in a common sense way, but the cold gnaws hungrily. 

When a danger cannot be obviated, and it threatens a disaster, the players at risk roll 2 dice, each adding their bonus to their own roll. 

The referee then rolls 2 dice, beforehand announcing if the situation is especially dangerous to add to the roll, or if the cold is lenient enough to allow the roll to be reduced.

Those who roll above the referee avoid danger, and those who roll lower suffer the consequences. 

If a player ties, they avoid the danger but suffer a consequence.

# Camp 3: Warmth

Characters have heat points equal to their Endurance + 6, and exposure will reduce this.

Keep track of time when exposed: 1 day = 6 watches = 24 hours. For every watch spent exposed in the cold, subtract one heat point.

If you drop to 0 heat points, you have frostbite. Another watch exposed kills, but warmth extends your life. The frostbitten area will not recover though.

Every hour spent in warmth, even that of a small campfire, recovers 1 heat point.

# Camp 4: Physical Exertion

A character may physically exert themself if deemed necessary.

To do so, choose a number of dice to be rolled, at least two. Roll, adding a relevant trait if appropriate.

The referee rolls two dice always.

Resolve the danger like any other roll. Every 6 that is rolled is a setback: a broken tool, a torn coat, a lost ration, as fits the activity of exertion.

If two or more of the players' dice show 6's, the environment turns treacherous, either by the activity or by the cold itself.

# Camp 5: Explorers' Journal

*Here is a record of play, to show you how the cold will drain you. Our players are Alice and Bob, playing with a referee George.*

George: You finally reach the caved-in mine. Rubble piles up, and fragments of old timber beams lie beside.

Alice: I have my dynamite. Is it clearly visible if the internal structure of the mine has held up?

George: It's not clear at the moment, it seems like a big pile of rubble at the base of a mountain. If you would like, you can spend an hour examining the mine entrance and the surrounding area for signs of other collapse or another entrance.

Bob: I only have 3 heat points after the day's journey. If we were to find an entrance, we would have to spend time to recover warmth to proceed within. I have binoculars, can I take a quick look to see if there is another entrance above the collapsed one?

George: You take a look, and you can see that there is a gap in the trees above the main entrance. Focusing the binoculars,you can barely make out a depression in the earth. It would seem like a vent for the mine.

Bob: Let's rest for now and try to climb up and descend that shaft afterwards. Should we make camp for now?

Alice: That sounds reasonable to me.

George: You break out your starter log and firewood from the dog sled. Soon enough, you have a fire going. How long do you want to let it burn?

Alice: Is an underground mine considered exposure to the cold; would we lose heat points in there?

George: While it will be chilly, the wind exposure is nonexistent. You just have to worry about getting into the shaft.

Bob: Then let's only let it burn for two hours. It shouldn't take much to get in there, and getting out and back to the sled should be just as easy.

Alice: Sounds good.

George: You sit by the fire for two hours. The sun gets lower in the sky, heading from afternoon to evening.

Bob: Let's get climbing and into the mine. 

George: The shaft entrance is 30 feet above ground level. I guess you're going to rope up and climb?

Alice: Yep! I pull out the anchor. I presume there's a spot for to anchor the rope?

George: There are a couple easily visible cracks. You take some time and anchor up, secure harnesses, put on helmets.

Bob: I'm worried about time. George, if we go slowly and safely, would we make it to the mineshaft by sunfall?

George: I doubt it, actually. You would need to pull out your lanterns to finish the climb.

Bob: I'm going to exert myself on my climb. I'll go first, I don't want to risk your safety, Alice.

Alice: Are you sure? This is kinda dangerous...

Bob: I'm pretty mobile, so I don't think it'll be a problem. To be sure, I'll roll three dice.

[Bob rolls 3 dice, adding mobility. He get 10, with one result of a six. George rolls two dice, getting an unfortunate 12].

Bob: The cold never relents, eh?

George: Never. While climbing, your boots' crampons break. You fall, but are caught by the rope. However, your cramons are busted now.

Alice: Time for dynamite, I guess...
