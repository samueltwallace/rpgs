**Apocalypse Never**

This is system prep for my *Apocalypse Never* Game. This is a combination of several systems: Knave, Maze Rats, Vaults of Vaarn, Cairn, and Liminal Horror.


# Character Management


Your character has 6 stats: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Roll 1d6 for each of them to get the scores *bonus.* Add 10 to the bonus to get that stat's *defense*. You can then swap two ability bonuses and corresponding defenses.

Roll 1d8 for starting hitpoints and add your constitution bonus.

Everyone starts with 3 days rations and a torch. Then roll as directed in Section [Equipment].

When a new campaign starts, choose an XP method: gold, stunts, or relics. For gold, 1000 gold recovered gives 1 XP. For stunts, XP is awarded at the end of a session, 1 for showing up, 2 for a clever use of tools, and 3 for defying the odds. For relics, every relic sold after adventuring gives 1 XP. The XP table is shown below:


| Advance to Level | at XP |
|:-----------------|:------|
| 2                | 2     |
| 3                | 6     |
| 4                | 12    |
| 5                | 20    |
| 6                | 30    |
| 7                | 42    |

When leveling up, roll your new level's number of d8's for new HP (if you roll below your current HP, increase HP by 1). You may also increase the ability bonuses and corresponding defenses of three different skills by 1.

You have a number of inventory slots equal to your Constitution defense. Use them sensibly and wisely.

You have a number of skill slots equal to your Intelligence bonus. You may fill one by memorizing a spell, training a combat or tactical skill, or training with an extra powerful weapon.

You also start with a skill. Choose one of the following:

1. +1 to any skill
2. A spell
3. Specialty:
   - Natural: excels in foraging, tracking, and navigating
   - Dextrous: excels in tinkering, picking locks & pockets
   - Nimble: Climbing, leaping, balancing, agility stunts
   - Stealthy: moving silently, staying out of sight, covering your tracks
   
# Magic

If you choose a spell, use *Maze Rats* to generate it.

When you cast the spell, roll a die corresponding to your Intelligence bonus:

| +int | die |
|:-----|:----|
| 1    | d4  |
| 2    | d6  |
| 3    | d8  |
| 4    | d10 |
| 5    | d12 |
| 6    | d20 |


On a 1, you suffer a magical mishap. Roll from *Maze Rats*.

Spells can only be cast once, and regenerate after a restful night of sleep.



# Combat

Combat is largely by Knave rules. Roll initiative every turn; on a 1-3 PC's go, on a 4-6, monsters go.

Roll a d20, adding strength bonus for melee weapons and wisdom for ranged weapons, and compare to defender's Armor Defense. If the attack roll with bonuses is less than the Defense, the attack misses; when greater or equal to the Defense, roll damage. 

When attacking and a 1 or 20 is rolled, special effects take place. Consult the Following table:

|     | 1                 | 20                                       |
|:---:|:-----------------:|:----------------------------------------:|
| PC  | -1 weapon quality | roll extra damage die                    |
| NPC | automatic miss    | -1 armor quality or scar (player choice) |


For a scar, use the table in Cairn [here](https://cairnrpg.com/cairn-srd/#scars-1).

If an item reaches 0 quality, it is destroyed forever.

# Equipment


## Armor

Armor items have *ratings.* (r). Use the following formulae:

Armor Rating = 10 + r

Inventory slots = r

Quality = 1 + r

Roll 2d6:



| Roll | Rating | Armor Item |
|:-----|--------|:-----------|
| 1    | 0      | No Armor   |
| 2-5  | 1      | Robes      |
| 6-7  | 2      | Gambeson   |
| 8-11 | 3      | Brigandine |
| 12   | 4      | Chain      |


Helmet and Shields provide additional armor bonuses (added on top of armor). 


| Roll  | Rating | Item            |
|:------|--------|:----------------|
| 1-13  | 0      | None            |
| 14-16 | 1      | Helmet          |
| 17-19 | 1      | Shield          |
| 20    | 2      | Helmet & Shield |


## Weapons

Weapons have *deadliness*. (d). Use the following formulae:

Inventory slots = d 

All weapons have quality 3.

Roll an additional d6. On 1-3, your weapon is melee. On a 4-6, it is ranged.

| Roll | Deadliness | Damage       |
|:-----|------------|--------------|
| 1    | 0          | d4 (Unarmed) |
| 2-6  | 1          | d6           |
| 7-11 | 2          | d8           |
| 12   | 3          | d10          |

For the specific form of your weapon, roll from Knave, Liminal Horror, or Vaarn equipment lists (or choose).


## Items

Roll 2d4, then roll for gear on the tables corresponding to your individual die rolls.
