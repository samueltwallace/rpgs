title: About Sam

This is Sam's (usual username quajzen) public repository of ideas for reading, tabletop RPGs, and the (few) thoughts I have about writing. I am a 25 year--old math graduate student living in Chicago.

I primarily run games in rules--minimal systems, some might call ultralight.

If you wanna reach out to me, you can find me at an email on my GitHub (https://github.com/samueltwallace ) or on Discord in the NSR server (`@quajzen`).
