**About Sam**

(insert ../header.md.html here)

This is Sam's (usual username quajzen) public repository of ideas for reading, tabletop RPGs, and the (few) thoughts I have about writing. I am a 24 year--old math graduate student living in Chicago.

I am almost obsessed with science fiction, fantasy, and horror (though Mad Men holds a special place in my heart). I like media that is experimental and bursting with imagination.

If you wanna reach out to me, you can find me at an email on my GitHub (https://github.com/samueltwallace ) or on Discord in the NSR server (`@quajzen`). If you're interested in other things I've done, you can check out my [links](https://linktr.ee/quajzen) for more.
