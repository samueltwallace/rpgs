**Cairn Mashup Rules**



<center>![](axe.png height="200px")   ![](blaster.jpg height="200px")</center>


The apocalypse is happening everywhere, to everyone, in every time. Timelines have merged for the end of the world. How will you survive?


This is an apocalyptic science fantasy ruleset for a world where you wander between desolate settlements and are just as likely to encounter a teleportation circle as a space shuttle launch pad, where you can hold your spellbook with your robotic third hand. 

The base ruleset is [Cairn](https://cairnrpg.com). This is a collection of various elements from hacks thereof.

Sources and Inspiration listed in Section [Sources and Inspiration].


# Character


Use the standard Cairn STR, DEX, and WIL stats, as well as HP, Armor, and Inventory mechanics.


## Leveling Up

*(From the Cairn Adventurer's Guide)*

Gain a new level every 1,000 XP. 1 XP is gained by bringing 1 gold back to safety.


When you level up, add 1d6 to your HP. Also, roll 3d6 for each stat, and if the result is higher than your current stat, add 1 to the stat.

# Equipment

Use the [Cairn equipment list](https://cairnrpg.com/cairn-srd/#equipment-list-prices-in-gold-pieces) in conjunction with the [Plerion equipment list](https://plerion.zeruhur.space/#/004_equipment). For equpiment costs, use 1 gold = 1 standard credit.

Use the Weapon Traits from the Cairn Adventurer's Guide. You may use any trait applicable to a magical weapon to an high-tech weapon.

Use the Shield Splintering rule from the Cairn Adventurer's Guide.
