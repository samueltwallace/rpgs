  \section{Introduction}

  This is a ruleset and toolkit for survival and travel in cold, snowy biomes.
  Here you will find rules for maintaining heat, traveling in snow, and seeking shelter in a harsh environment.
  You can use any part of these rules in place or alongside other travel procedures you have for the adventures in the far northern reaches of your campaign world.
  Ideas for arctic adventures are included. \\

  \subsection*{Overview}

  Players get an extra metric called \emph{heat capacity}.
  This measures how long they can stay warm.
  Heat capacity is numerically tracked the same way as players' health in your system - be that in hit dice, hits, or something else. \\
  
  Eating away at players' heat is exposure.
  In each time unit of travel, hours, watches, or days, the Referee makes an exposure roll and adds weather or seasonal modifiers.
  The total of the roll and modifiers is subtracted from every player's heat capacity. \\
