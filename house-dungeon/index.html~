**House on the Hill**


This is a system--agnostic dungeon for classic scares in a spooky old house. 

This adventure is system agnostic: it has no stats associated to each combat-able enemy, but instead a *threat level.* Threat levels range from 1 to 5, with a threat level 1 indicating that this NPC is disposed of quite easily, and a threat level 5 indicating a nigh--impossible combat challenge.

You will have to do some work to fit this to your system. Threat levels are only a bare-bones scale of difficulty.



# Overview

This adventure takes place in a deserted house on a hill. There are several things going on in this house:

 - A cult has taken up residence in the excavated basement, trying to summon a demon
 - A vampire has been living
